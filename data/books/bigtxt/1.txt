4 PREFACE. 

In this biographical history the editorial staflf, as well as the publishers, 
have fully realized the magnitude of the task. In the collection of the 
material there has been a constant aim to discriminate carefully in regard 
to the selection of subjects. Those who have been prominent factors in 
the public, social and industrial development of the counties have been 
given due recognition as far as it has been possible to secure the requisite 
data. Names worthy of perpetuation here, it is true, have in several in- 
stances been omitted, either on account of the apathy of those concerned 
or the inability of the compilers to secure the information necessary for a 
symmetrical sketch; but even more pains have been taken to secure ac- 
curacy than were promised in the prospectus. Works of this nature, 
therefore, are more reliable and complete than are the "standard" histories 
of a country. THE PUBLISHERS.

BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY 

OF THE 

First Cofi2;ressioiial District ot New Jersey. 



JOHN FENWICK. 



T OHN FENWICK was born in Northumberland county at Stanton 
I Manor, in England, in the year 1618. He was a lawyer and was made 
^^ a captain of cavaln,' by Cromwell and took an active part against the 
throne. He was a member of the Society of Friends, and, like many others 
of that religious faith and their descendants, was imprisoned for conscience' 
sake. About the year 1665 Lord Berkley offered West New Jersey for sale. 
There appears to have been an understanding between one Edward Billinger 
and Fenwick to purchase the whole of West New Jersey and for Fenwick to 
have one-tenth of the land. The deed was given for the land in 1673, Fen- 
wick's portion being what is now Salem and Cumberland counties. He then 
made preparations to emigrate and take possession of the land in America, 
and held out inducements for others to emigrate with him. A number 
accepted the invitation of Fenwick, most of them being of his own religious 
faith. Fenwick's friends had great faith in his honesty and some of them 
purchased land and paid him before they embarked. The following are the 
names of some of the principal persons who embarked with John Fenwick: 
John Pledger, Samuel Nicholson, James Nevil, Edward Wade, Robert Wade. 
Samuel Wade, Robert Windham, Richard Hancock and their families, and 
several others. There were several single men,— Samuel Hedge, Jr., Isaac 
siar^ and others. The servants that hired in England to persons above 
mentioned and likewise to John Fenwick and his two sons-in-law, were 
Robert Turner, Gewas Bywater, William Wilkinson, Joseph Worth, Joseph 
Ware, Michael Eaton, Eleanor Geeve, Nathaniel Chambless, his son, Nathan 
Chambless, Jr., Mark Reeve, Edward Webb and Elizabeth Walters. 

Smith, in his history of New Jersey, says in many instances the servants 
became more conspicuous members of civil and religious society than their 



l8 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

employers. Fenwick's immediate family that came with him were his daugh- 
ter Elizabeth and her husband, John Adams, his daughter Anne Fenwick, 
who married Samuel Hedge, Jr., the spring following, and his youngest 
daughter, Priscilla, whose husband was Edward Champney. His wife, Mary 
Fenwick, did not accompany him to his new home in the wilderness, for some 
cause that has never been explained. The letters passed between them 
manifested a sincere and filial attachment, and they continued to correspond 
while life remained. They embarked from London in the ship Griffith, 
Robert Griffith being master, on the 23d of the ninth month. They arrived 
at the mouth of Assamhockin creek, now called Salem creek, and' ascended 
the stream about three miles, and landed at a point of land. Fenwick and 
his friends that were with him thought it a suitable location for a town. He 
gave it the name of New Salem, because he remarked to one of his intimate 
friends the name signifies peace; but it did not prove so to him, as the sequel 
of his history w'ill show. He, like his great friend and benefactor, William 
Penn, and also Roger Williams, found in settling colonies there were more 
thorns than roses. On account of the low ground, Salem was sometimes 
called Swamp Town. 

As soon as it w-as practicable after the early settlers of Salem landed, the 
proprietor held a council with the Indian chiefs that lived within the compass 
of Salem county, and purchased all their land of them, thereby securing 
perpetual peace with the natives, and the same kind of a treaty was made with 
them by Billynge or his agents for the remainder of West Jersey. They re- 
served certain rights for themselves, — trapping, fishing, and the privilege 
of cutting certain kinds of wood for the purpose of making baskets, also in 
making their canoes and other things. The treaty was faithfully fulfilled. 
About the year 1800 the few remaining Indians in this state made application 
to the New Jersey legislature to sell all their rights and privileges they held 
in the state, which was accepted by the legislature, and they were paid the 
price they asked. They then removed to the state of New York to dwell with 
the Mohawks and other scattering tribes that remained in that state. 

John Fenwick, after his arrival in Salem, issued a proclamation granting 
civil and reHgious liberty to all persons who should settle within his province. 
In the year 1676, he turned his attention to providing homes for his children, 
and accordingly directed Richard Hancock, his surveyor, to lay out and sur- 
vey two thousand acres in Upper Mannington fo'r Samuel Hedge, Jr., and 
his wife Anne. The said land was called Hedgefield. He also directed him 
to survey two thousand acres for his son-in-law, Edward Champney, and 
his wife Priscilla, which land was bounded on the west by John Smith's land, 
on the north by James Nevel's farm, and AUoway's creek on the south. To 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEJV JERSEY. 19 

his son-in-law, John Adams, and his wife EUzalieth. he gave all that tract of 
land located in what is now called Penn's Neck. It is known at the present 
day as the Sapaney. Fenwick built himself a house in the town of Salem 
on what he called Ivy Point. From said house he was forcibly taken in the 
middle of the night by a party of men from New Castle and taken to that 
town, from thence sent to New York, and there imprisoned by an order of 
Governor Andross. under i)retense that he was infringing upon the rights of 
that state, which they claimed to own to the eastern shore of the Delaware 
river. He was soon afterward released. 

After two or three years more of perplexities and trouble in endeavoring 
to establish a government in the colony, he wisely abandoned it by selling 
all the lands he had in the Salem tenth (reserving one hundred and fifty thou- 
sand acres for himself and family), to Governor William Penn. The deed 
was given the 23d day of ]\Iarch, U1S2. From that time the whole of \\'est 
Jersey was under one government. The legislature met at Burlington, and 
Samuel Jennings, of that place, was elected deputy governor at the first legis- 
lature afterward. John Fenwick was elected one of the members of that 
body from Salem county, in the fall of 1683, but being unwell he left his 
home in Salem and went to Samuel Hedge's, his son-in-law, in U])per Man- 
nington, there to be cared for by his favorite daughter, Anne Hedge, in his 
last" days, for he died a short time aftenvard, at the age of sixty-five years. 
He requested before his death to be buried in the Sharp's family burying- 
ground, which was complied with. The said ground was formerly a i)art of 
the Salem county almshouse farm. 

On July II, 1688, John Fenwick issued a warrant to Richard Tindall, Sur- 
veyor-General for Salem county, and to John WoolriUge, his deputy, to lay 
out one acre of land in Salem on which to erect a court-honse and prison. 
This was done and the buildings were erected on Bridge street, afterward 
called Market street. 

In 181 7 an election was held to decide whether the court-house should lie 
removed from the one-acre lot where it now stands. The majority of the in- 
habitants in Piles Grove, both Pittsgroves, Uiqier Penn's Neck and Upper 
Alloway's Creek were in favor of removing the county Iniildings. Where 
the place should be there was a diversity of opinion. Alloway was suggested, 
while others were in favor of Woodstown. By a survey of the county, the 
almshouse farm was found to be the most central. The election was held to 
remove the countv buildings to the south end of said farm, or for them to 
remain in Salem. It was decided by a large m.ijority of voters for them to 
remain. 



BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY Ol- THE FIRST 



HON. GEORGE HIRES. 

If there is a name indeliljly written u])on the pages of Salem's com- 
mercial and i>olitical history, it is the name of Hon. George Hires, a pro; 
grassive business man who for nearly half a century has been identified with 
ever^• marked improvement the county has witnessed. He is a son of George 
and Mary (Royal) Hires and was born in Elsinboro. Salem county. New 
Jersey, January 26, 1835. His paternal ancestors came from Germany 
to America and settled in Cumberland county, this state, where John Hires. 
the grandfather of our subject, was born. 

For several years John Hires was a farmer of Cumberland county, but 
during his later years moved to Salem, where he lived to the advanced age 
of ninety-four years, enjoying that immunity from toil which a long life of 
industry accorded him. He married, and raised a large family of children, 
among whom was George Hires, born February 7, 1802. George Hires 
was also a farmer and soon after his marriage to Miss Mary Royal moved 
to Salem count)-. Sexeral years before his death he took up his residence 
in Salem, where he lived a quiet and retired life. He was a member of the 
Presbyterian church, a man of upright and honoraiile character, whose life 
was above the breath of reproach. 

Hon. George Hires received his early education in the district school near 
Quinton and in the Friends" School at Salem. Leaving the halls of edu- 
cation at the early age of fifteen, he worked on a farm for three years, when 
he entered a store in Quinton, in the capacity of clerk. One year later he 
was admitted into partnership with David P. Smith, and the firm of Smith 
& Hires continued for five years, until 1861, when Mr. Hires purchased 
the interest of his partner and continued alone for one year, when his 
brother, Oiarles Hires, elsewhere represented in this work, became associated 
with him, the firm doing business under the name of G. & C. Hires. Two 
years later the firm of Smith, Hires, Lambert & Companv was formed for 
the purpose of manufacturing window glass, and the plant ultimately in- 
stalled by that company was the Quinton Glass Works. 

Just here it may be interesting to mention that on the 24th of October, 
1863. the first window glass was made in Quinton. During the intervening 
years changes have been made in the firm, but George Hires has always been 
identified with it, and the present firm known as Hires & Compan}', com- 
posed of George Hires, Charles Hires and William Plummer, Jr., has been 
in existence since 1881. In addition to this plant, they have a large whole- 
sale jobbing house at 626 Arch street, Philadelphia, which was established 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF XEIC JERSEY.. 21 

in 1878. This firm is known as the Hires-Tnnier Glass Company, of which 
our sul)ject is the president. He is also the vice president of the Foggs & 
Hires Canning Company, which has factories at Ouinton. Hancock's Bridge 
and PennsviUe. Like his ancestors, he is very much interested in agricul- 
ture and with other landed property owns the homestead farm near 
Quinton. which has heen in the possession of the family for more than half a 
century He has been a director in the Salem National Bank for eighteen 
vears and was one of the organizers of the New Jersey Trust & Safe Deposit 
Company, when he was chosen a director and has fille.l the oftice ever since. 
His success in public life has been no less marked than in the commer- 
cial. In politics he has always been a Republican, and was elected the 
sheriff of this countv in 1867 by one of the largest majorities ever given m 
the countv. In 1881 he was elected to the state senate. It was during his 
term in the senate that the corporation tax bill was passe.l from which the 
state has been so greatlv benefited. In 1884 he was elected to the forty-nmth 
congress and in 1886 re-elected to the fiftieth. In 1894 he was appointed 
by Governor Werts a member of the New Jersey constitutional-amendment 
convention. In 1896 he was chosen a delegate to the national convention 
held at St. Louis, which nominate.l William ^IcKinley for president and 
Garrett A. Hobart for vice president. He has been a member of the New 
Jersev state committee for ten years, which position he still holds. 

He was married in 1856, to Miss Ann Eliza Patrick, who die.l within a 
few months, and in January, 1859, he married Miss Elizabeth K. Plummer, 
a daughter of Judge William Plummer. Two children survive this marriage. 
—Lucius E. and Bessie K. Hires. His present wife is Mrs. Artie C. Hogate, 
nee Paget, whom he married in 1881. This union has been honored by the 
birth of two children,— Mary Ethel and George Hires, Jr. 



EDWARD B. HUMPHREYS. 

No history of \\'oodstown would be complete without the record of Ed- 
ward Bilderback Humphreys, so closely has he been associated with the mer- 
cantile interests of the city. The material welfare of Woodstown is attribut- 
able in no small degree to his efforts, for he belongs to that class of repre- 
sentative Americans who while promoting individual success also advance 
the general prosperit\-. From a low ly position in life he has gradually worked 
his way upward, overcoming many dilficulties and obstacles yet never falter- 
ing in his determination to win for himself a place in the business world. He 
is to-day one of the most iirominent merchants and real-estate owners of 



22 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OP PHP PIRST 

Woodstown, yet is entirely free from ostentation, in fact is extremely re- 
served and at all times avoids personal notoriety. But genuine merit and 
success cannot be hidden, and the aliilit}" tliat has won him success has 
brought him prominentl}- before the jjublic. 

Mr. Hum])lireys was born in the little village of Sharptown, Salem county, 
August 31, 1830, his parents being Samuel and Rachel (Bilderback) Humph- 
reys. He was one of seven children, and his early youth was passed at his 
parental home and in attendance at the village school, wdiere he pursued his 
studies under the direction of Messrs. Bullock, Cochran and Lippincott. His 
opportunities, however, in that direction were somewhat limited, he being- 
able to obtain only the rudiments of an education in the school-room. 
Through reading, experience and observation, however, he has become a 
well-informed man. 

In early life Mr. Humphreys worked on a farm for a time and later went 
to Philadfc'liihia. \\hereb_\- he permanentl_\- se\-ered his connection with agri- 
cultural interests. Aliout 1850 he returned to Sharptown and soon began 
business on his own accoimt. ^^'ith borrowed capital he purchased a small 
stock of merchandise and o]3ened a store, continuing in business there for 
about eight or ten years, w hen he dis])Osed of his interest in his nati\'e town 
and came to his present place of residence. Here he purchased the store 
then owned liy Joseph K. Riley, conducting the store for about a year, when 
he sold out, at a good profit, to Messrs. Lawson & Pancoast. Soon after- 
ward he purchased the corner lot now occupied by his present store and resi- 
dence. In 1864 he erected the business block, and from that time has con- 
ducted one of the largest, best equipped and complete general mercantile 
stores in this \n\r\. of the state. In 1868 he admitted Edward Wallace to a 
partnership in the business and that relation was maintained for seventeen 
years, when, in 1885, Mr. \\'allace withdrew. Mr. Humphreys still conducts 
the business and has a \e\-y large patronage. He has carefully studied the 
public taste, and his earnest desire to please his ]iatrons, combined with his 
reliability, has won him a large trade. 

Along other lines Mr. Humphre\-s has lieen closely allied with the busi- 
ness interests of Woodstown. He has made extensive and judicious invest- 
ments in real estate, and has thus contributed to the upbuilding of the city. 
In 1 88 1 he purchased the old Ford hotel property, and a few years later he 
sold a few feet at the corner at exactly the price paid for the entire amount. 
In 1885 he erected a tine opera-house on Salem street, and in 1886 he also 
built on the Ford property a pantaloon factory. In 1888 he erected the fine 
hotel on East avenue, one of the finest buildings of the town, doing this for 
the purpose of furnishing a place of entertainment for the tra\eling public

where they would not be surrounded by the influences of intoxicants. He 
is a man of strictly temperance principles, and without regard for the 
financial side of the question he erected the hotel; the investment, however, 
has proved a profitable one. He was one of the organizers of the Woodstown 
First National Bank; for a time, however, he was not associated with that 
institution. Many of its directors preferred an up-town location, somewhat 
removed from the business center, and, believing this unwise, Mr. Humph- 
reys severed his connection with the institution. Some years later, however, 
the wisdom of his opinion was demonstrated, and to-day the bank is occupy- 
ing an excellent site in the center of the town, sold to them by Mr. Humph- 
reys. He is the owner of much valuable city property, comprising three of 
the best business corners in the town. 

Another enterprise which elicited his attention and aid was the Woods- 
town Monitor. In 1885 he began the publication of a bright, interesting 
journal, which was at first printed at the office of the Gazette, in Camden, 
and later at the home office in Woodstown. This journal is now owned and 
published by Benjamin Patterson, Esquire, and has been consolidated with 
the Woodstown Register, under the name of the Monitor-Register. 

In 1858 Mr. Humphreys was united in marriage to Miss Jennie Webb 
Null, a daughter of William Null, at that time the proprietor of Null's 
Mills. Their children are Mary, William, Edward and Belle: but William 
died in 1879, at the age of nineteen years. 

Such, in brief, is the history of one of Woodstown's leading and influen- 
tial business men, and the record of his life should well serve as an illustration 
of what may be accomplished through determined purpose, unflagging 
energy and laudable ambition. 



WYATT W. MILLER. 



\\'yatt \\^istar Miller, one of the oldest business men of Salem, is con- 
nected with the Salem Banking Company and is one of the city's most highly 
esteemed residents. He is a son of Josiah and Hettie (James) Miller, and 
was born November i, 1828, in Mannington township, this county, the birth- 
place of several generations of his ancestors. In 1698 Joseph Miller, his 
great-great-great-grandfather, came from the state of Connecticut and settled 
at Cohansey, this county, in order to enjoy the freedom of religious expres- 
sion. The New England states at that time refused the Society of Friends 
that freedom which thev claimed for themseh'es. and many of the members of

that denomination sought homes in Rhode Island and tlie western states. 
Joseph was a surveyor and was chosen deputy surveyor for the lower section 
of Fenwick's tenth. He did a great deal of work and stood high in his pro- 
fession. He had one son, Ebenezer, who was born in 1702 and succeeded to his 
father's business at the death of the latter in 1730. Ebenezer Miller was the 
great-great-grandfather of our subject and married Sarah, a daughter of John 
Collier, by whom he had a large family of children, namely: Ebenezer, Jr., 
born in 1725; Hannah, born in 1728 and married to Charles Fogg; Josiah, 
bom in 1731; Andrew, born in 1732; William, born in 1735: John, born in 
1737; Mark, born in 1740; Sarah, born in 1743; and Rebecca, born in 1747. 
Ebenezer Miller lived to reach the age of seventy-tw o years and passed his 
last days in the town of Greenwich, this state. 

Josiah William Miller, the great-grandfather, was the second son of his 
parents and was married to Letitia Wood in 1760. She was a daughter of 
Richard Wood, Sr., of Slow Creek township, Cumberland county, this state. 
By their union were five children, namely: Josiah, Jr., born in 1761; Rich- 
ard, in 1764; John, in 1767; Letitia, who was born in 1769 and became the 
wife of William Reeves: and Mark, born in 1774. He purchased a large 
tract of land in Mannington township, which formerly belonged to the south- 
ern part of the James Sherron allotment of one thousand acres which he 
bought of John Fenwick in 1676, one of the finest tracts of land in Fenwick's 
tenth. He built a substantial brick house upon it, and his willleft twenty- 
five hundred dollars and a number of legacies to be divided up among his 
relatives. His son Richard was born on this farm, a part of which is now in 
the possession of our subject, and there grew to manhood. He was a hus- 
bandman and owned one hundred and sixty acres of the original homestead, 
which was a valuable piece of property. He was a member of the Society 
of Friends and died while attending their quarterly meeting in Burlington 
courity some time in the '40s. He married Elizabeth Wyatt Wistar, whose 
mother was a Wyatt, and reared three children: Josiah, father of our sub- 
ject; Sarah (Mrs. Benjamin Acton); and Letitia, who married Thomas P. 
Sheppard. The grandmother reached the extreme age of eighty-seven years 
and died in 1856. Josiah Miller was also born on the old homestead farm in 
Mannington township about 1799 and his death occurred on the anniversary 
of this day thirty-four years later. He was a farmer by occupation and a 
strong Whig. By his marriage to Hettie James he had three sons: Richard, 
who was born December 5, 1823, and followed the life of an agriculturist in 
his native township, was married to Elizabeth Blackwood, who died childless, 
and afterward he chose a second wife, who bore him one son, Richard; Sam- 
uel, who was born February 12, 1824, and was a farmer of Mannington town-

ship, married Hannah Rumsey and had one son, Wyatt. Wyatt Wistar is 
the youngest. After the death of the father the widow married David Reeves, 
of Philadelphia, witli whom slie Hved until her seventieth year, when death 
severed the bond. 

Wyatt \\'istar ^Miller was educated in the common schools of Salem and 
Bridgeton and was an apt pupil, diligent and earnest, who added to the store 
of wisdom thus obtained by comprehensive reading and keen observation. 
After leaving school he was employed on a farm for a short time and then 
went to Safe Harbor, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, where he was en- 
gaged in the manufacture of pig and railroad iron from 1850 until 1867. He 
moved upon his farm at this time and was engaged in husbandry for twenty- 
two years, when he moved to Salem, where he has since resided. Several 
years before, he had become identified with the Salem National Bank, and 
was a director of the institution from 1872 until 1886, when he was elected 
the president. He is well adapted for the duties of this office, being a genial, 
pleasant man of great force of character and remarkable perspicuity of speech 
and conduct, whose push and energy lent strength to whatever cause he 
espoused. 

Mr. ]\liller was married ^lay 12, 1858, to MissMary L. Griffin, a daugh- 
ter of John (iriffin, who as the manager of the iron works at Safe Harbor 
was the predecessor of our subject. He resided at Phoeni.xville, Pennsyl- 
vania, at his death, and had two children, — Mrs. Miller and a son who was in 
the navy and was buried at sea. Mr. Miller has nine children, namely: Josiah, 
Jr., born in August, 1859, is a surveyor by profession and an insurance agent 
by occupation, residing at Salem: he married Mary Ann Thompson and has 
three children, — Alice, Esther G. and an infant: Samuel is a farmer; Robert 
is a manufacturer of dental supplies in Philadelphia: he married Miss Speak- 
man and has four children; Mary L., born in 1867, married J. Forman Sinnd- 
kon, a lawyer of Salem, by whom she has one child. Elizabeth; Hettie, who 
married Collins B. Allen, a farmer of ^lannington township: they have three 
children, — Elsie, Mary and Elizabeth; Wyatt Wistar was a clerk in the pen- 
sion office at \\'ashington and died in that office January 19. 1899; George 
is employed in the bank and is unmarried; Elizabeth is also unmarried, as is 
John, the ninth and youngest child. Mr. Miller is a stanch Republican and 
was elected to the office of state senator from Salem county in 1885, dis- 
charging the duties incumbent upon him in a manner highly satisfactory to 
his constituents. He is a well preserved, handsome old gentleman whose 
intellectual vigor is in no wise impaired by age and his business ability to-day 
will bear comparison with any of our younger men. 



26 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



HENRY M. RUMSEY. 

Mr. Rumsey is the well known cashier of the Salem National Banking 
Company. Banking institutions are the heart of the commercial body indi- 
cating the healthfulness of trade, and the bank that follows a safe, conserva- 
tive business policy does more to establish public confidence in times of wide- 
spread financial depression than anything else. Such a course has the Salem 
National Banking Company followed under the able management of Mv. 
Rumsey and his associates, who direct its aiifairs. Eor many years he has 
been associated with the financial interests of the city, and at all times he has 
commanded the public confidence by his reliable business methods and his 
fidelity to the trust reposed in him. 

Mr. Rumsey has spent his entire life in Salem county, his birth having 
occurred August 24, 1838, his parents being George C. and Margaret (Can- 
arroe) Rumsey. Through many generations the ancestry of the family can 
be traced, and the history embraces the records of men of sterling worth who 
in the various walks of life have won success. The founder of the family in 
America was Charles Rumsey, who emigrated from Wales to America in 
1665, landing at Charleston, South Carolina, whence he went to New York 
and Philadelphia, locating finally at the head of Bohemia river, in Cecil 
county, Maryland. He had eight children, and to two of them, Charles and 
William, he left three hundred acres of land, the home plantation,- and to a 
third son, Edward, he left one hundred acres. One of the sons of the latter. 
James Rumsey, w-as born on the farm at the head of Bohemia river. He in- 
vented a steamboat, propelled by the reaction of a stream of water, which 
by the agency of steam was forced out of the stern through a cylinder parallel 
to the keel. This invention was a decided success and was largely used in 
navigation until more modern methods supplanted it. He was born in 1743 
and moved to the state of Virginia, where he was living at the time he per- 
fected his invention. In 1792 he went to London and while delivering a lec- 
ture explaining the methods he had employed he was stricken with apoplexy 
and died before medical help could reach him. 

William Rumsey, the son of Charles Rumsey. the Welsh emigrant, was 
born April 21, 1698, and became a surveyor of note. He assisted in locating 
the state line betw^een Pennsylvania and Maryland in 1739 and performed 
other important surveying service. He also acted as a collector of customs. 
and became one of the most extensive land-owners of Cecil county, leaving 
about thirty-five thousand acres of land to his heirs. The old Rumsey man- 
sion was a magnificent specimen of colonial architecture, picturesqueh^ situ-

ated on an eminence commanding a wide expanse of beautiful country m 
Middle Neck. Cecil county; but the processes of time have long since reduced 
it to a state of decay and ruin, while the name, once so honored and promi- 
nent in the history of Cecil county, is now almost unknown there, the de- 
scendants having disposed of their inheritance and moved northward to Phd- 
adelphia. New Jersey and Illinois. In those places, however, the name is 
now no less honored, for its representatives have become important factors 
in the various localities where they reside. William Rumsey, of Cecil county, 
married Sabina IJlankinburg, and left three sons and two daughters at his 
death in 1742. 

Colonel Charles Rumsey. one of his children, was born in 1736 and took 
an active part in the struggle for independence in the war of the Revolution. 
He was a member of the Maryland council in 1775, the Maryland council of 
safety in the following year, and was the colonel of the Elk Battalion, Cecil 
county militia, in the same }-ear. He married Aliigail Jane Caner, who was 
born in }J4(k and died in Feljruary. 1827. She was a daughter of Rev. 
Richard and Emma (Oxen) Caner. her father a minister of the Episcopal 
church, residing in Cecil county, Maryland. Unto Mr. and Mrs. Rumsey 
were born ten children, among whom was Benjamin, the grandfather of 
Henry M. Rumsey. He was born January 26, 1772, in that county, and be- 
came very wealthy, having extensive landed possessions. He married Miss 
Mary Clark, a daughter of George Clark, of Delaware. Their children were 
Charles, who married Hannah Mulford; Ann Jane, wife of Bacon Ware: 
George C. the father of our subject; and Eliza B., who died in 1805. The 
father of these children was called to his final rest April i, 1803. 

George C. Rumsey was a native of Middletown, Delaware, and was born 
November 24, 1798. He removed to Salem, where for many years he was 
engaged in general merchandising, following that pursuit until about the 
vear 1841. In 1835 he was elected a director of the Salem Banking Com- 
pany and continued to hold that office until his death, in 1851. In 1842 he 
was made the cashier of the bank and was one of the most efificient officers 
that has ever been connected with the institution. He was also interested 
in various other business enterprises and owned several tracts of land in 
the county. His political support was given the Democratic party in his 
early life, but subsequently he joined the ranks of the Whig party. He was 
an honored member of the First Presljyterian church of Salem, served as 
one of its elders and took an active part in its work. He died December 28, 
1 85 1, at the age of fifty-two years, and his wife passed away April 9, 1883. 
at the advanced age of eighty-six years.

county. He was pro\-ided' \\\t\\ good educational ]ii"i\-i!eges. pursuing his 
studies in Salem, in Mount Holh' and in Princeton. It fell to his lot to 
assume charge of extensive business interests at an age when most lads are 
thinking only of amusements, for his father died \\hen he was only thirteen 
years of age, and it became necessary for him to assume an early control of 
his inheritance. As soon as his education \\ as completed lie began the culti- 
vation of the farm and carried on agricultural pursuits until 1867. meeting 
with creditable success in his undertakings. Four years prior to this time 
he was elected to the oi^ce of director in the Salem Banking Company, a 
position formerly held by his father, and in 1866 he accepted a clerkship in 
the Salem National Banking Company's establishment. In 1871 he was 
promoted to the position of assistant cashier, and after serving in that ca- 
pacity for ten )ears he was elected cashier. For eighteen vears lie has dis- 
charged the duties of that place, and the success of the bank is attributable 
in no small measure to his enterprise, keen discernment and systematic busi- 
ness methods. His efforts have by no means l)een limited to this line of 
endea^'or, for he is a man of resourceful ability and his wise counsel has 
proved an important factor in the successful conduct of many other business 
interests. He is a member of the board of trade. 

Mr. Rumsey was married November 24, 1859, to Aliss Maria Elliott, a 
daughter of Benjamin Bassett. a prominent farmer of Mannington township 
and a director in the Salem National Bank. She was one of four children, 
namely: Sarah, the wife of Barkley Griscon. an agriculturist of ^lannington 
township: Rachel, the wife of Collins Allen, a farmer: Richard, who married 
Ann Grier and is a retired farmer of Salem: and Maria, the wife of our subject. 
Mr. and Mrs. Rumsey have three children: Margaret C, who was born in 
April, 1861, and is now the wife of Thomas Tatnail. a real-estate dealer of 
Wilmington, Delaware, by whom she has three children, — IMarjery. Henr\- 
R., Thomas, Jr.; George Benjamin, who was born in June. 18A5, and has 
held several official positions; and Mary Acton, now the wife of R. Wyatt 
^Vistar. George B. has been a member of the board of education and has 
efificiently served as the city treasurer. He is also one of the trustees of the 
Presbyterian church. The family is one of prominence in the community, 
holding a high position in social circles, and their home is celebrated for its 
hospitality. 

In all the affairs which concern the welfare of the city Mr. Rumsey takes a 
deep and practical interest, withholding his support from no measure or 
movement which is calculated to advance the public prosperity. He is one of 
the charter members of the New Jersey branch of the Sons of the Revolu- 
tion, is a member of the Presbvterian church and one of its elders. He does

all in liis power to promote the growth of the church and contributes very 
liherall}' to its support. He is courteous, genial, well informed, alert and en- 
terprising. 



THE SALEM NATIONAL BANKING COMPANY. 

The Salem National Banking Company, of Salem, New Jersey, has had a 
long and prosperous career. It was first established in 1823, as the Salem 
Steam Mil! & Banking Company, of which William N. Jef¥ers was president 
and William Mulford cashier. Among the incorporators of the company 
were Samuel Clement, Richard Craven, Daniel Garrison, Benjamin Griscom, 
Morris Hancock, William N. Jeffers, Joseph Kille. William Mulford, James 
Newell, Jonathan Richman, Jere- 
miah Stull, John Tuft and Daniel 
Vanneman, who were elected the 
first directors. 

At a meeting of the board of di- 
rectors, held July 25, 1825. the 
steam mill was ordered sold, which 
was subsequently done, and the 
banking business continued under 
successive presidents and cashiers 
as follows: Presidents, John G. 
Mason, Morris Hancock and Calvin 
Belden: cashiers, William Mulford, 
Louis P. Smith, John Elwell and 
George C. Rumsey. The Salem 
National Banking Company was or- 
ganized in July, 1865, under the 
acts of legislature governing such 
institutions, and it is the successor 
of the old bank, which declared a 
dividend, at its closing out, of 

one hundred per cent payable in the stock of the new organization, making an 
increase of capital from seventy-five to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
Among the incorporators of the present bank were George W. Garrison, 
Henry B. Ware, Jonathan Woodnut, Benjamin Acton, Joseph Kille, O. B. 
Stoughton, Joseph Bassett, Henry M. Rumsey, John C. Belden, Jonathan 
House, Isaac Johnson, Edwin A. Vanneman, James \\oolman and Charles 
Wood, all now dead except Messrs. Rumsey and Belden. George W. Garrison

died November 26, 1875, and was succeeded 1)y Charles Wood, who died in 
October, 1877, and was succeeded by C. M. Eakin. He died in 1887 and was 
succeeded by ex-Senator Wyatt W. Miller, the present incumbent. In 1871 
Mr. Ware resigned the cashiership, on account of failing health, and was suc- 
ceeded by Benjamin Acton, Henry M. Rumsey being elected assistant cash- 
ier. At the death of Mr. Acton, in September, 1881, ]\Ir. Rumsey was elected 
cashier and F. M. Acton was made assistant. 

It has had a prosperous career and enjoys the confidence of the general 
public, occupying a well merited position in tjie banking circles of the coun- 
try. It is in charge of efficient and obliging officers, who are men of integ- 
rity and well calculated to take charge of a business of that proportion. The 
directors elected at the last annual meeting were Robert S. Bunting, John M. 
Carpenter, George Hires, Jacob House, L. A. D. Allen, Wyatt W. Miller, 
Henry M. Rumsey, Tliomas Sinnickson, Jr., and Josiah Summerill; presi- 
dent, W'yatt W. Miller, and cashier Henry M. Rumsey, who has been officially 
connected with the institution since 1866 and proved himself a capable and 
efficient man. The capital stock of the company is one hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars. It has individual deposits ranging from three hundred and 
fifty thousand to over a half million dollars, while its real estate is worth over 
fifty thousand dollars. The par value of the stock is fifty dollars but now sells 
for more than one hundred, while the regular annual dividends range from 
ten to twelve per cent. 

Tlie building occupied by the Salem National Banking Company is one of 
the finest in southern New Jersey and was erected in 1888. It is command- 
ing in appearance, conveniently located on Broadway near the head of Mar- 
ket street, and is both convenient and ornamental. It is a two-story brick 
structure with stone trimming, a compromise between plain and ornamental, 
that gives a pleasing appearance, the front being of a turret style of architec- 
ture. Heavy open-work iron doors, with glass in the inside, guard the en- 
trance, which is through a vaulted vestibule, the inner doors of heavy oak and 
glass admitting to the banking room, which is very commodious, open to the 
roof and well lighted, the ceiling being beautifully finished and frescoed. 
Back of these is the vault, massive and both burglar and fire proof in appear- 
ance as well as fact. It is of the Diebold pattern, with all the improvements. 
The door is secured by time and combination locks, and in the vault are the 
cash box, also guarded by a time lock, and deposit boxes for the accommoda- 
tion of the public. In the rear of the vault is a large room for the use of 
those having deposit boxes, and is furnished with a large hardwood table, 
stationary washstand and other conveniences. To the right are the presi- 
dent's and cashier's rooms, which are handsomelv furnished, with hardwood

corner mantels and open fire-places, the floor being covered with a handsome 
velvet carpet. Above these are the directors', the watchman's and the toilet 
rooms, all furnished in the same general manner. The partitions are partly 
of heavy plate glass, so that the front of the building is always within easy 
view. The entire inside finish is of quartered oak, there being ample space in 
the banking room for the accommodation of the public. There is a small 
room on each side of the entrance, which is supplied with tables and chairs, 
for the convenience of the bank's patrons, and there are ample seat and desk 
accommodations to render the transaction of business both inviting and 
pleasant. The building is heated throughout by hot air, indirect, from a 
boiler in the basement. This part has a cement floor and is constructed with 
the same thoroughness that characterizes the entire building. It can be 
lighted either by gas or electricity, and is supplied with burglar alarms, tlie 
entire building being thoroughly ventilated by an automatic arrangement. 
Over the entrance is the profile, cut in stone, of the late Major Benjamin 
Acton, so long connected with the bank, and who was the cashier at the time 
of his death. The building was erected under the supervision of the archi- 
tect, David Evans, of Philadelphia, and is a credit to his skill and the enter- 
prise of the directors under whom it was erected. 



THE VAN :\IETER FA:\IILY, 

Ancestral notes relating to the Van Meter family of Salem county. New 
Jersey, and their connections, are presented in this compilation. 

Some centuries ago a part of the province of Gelderland, in the Nether- 
lands, was called Meteren. It is thought the people who went from that 
town came to be called by it "van," indicating "from." However that may 
be, the name, in various spellings, has been borne by people who have dis- 
tinguished themselves in religious and literary labors. Jacob van Meteren, 
of Antwerp, caused the first complete edition of the Bible to be printed in 
the English language. This book was published at Zurich, in 1536, and was 
a great and expensive work. It is supposed that Van Meteren made the 
translations himself, employing an English scholar. Miles Coverdale, to 
supervise the printing, to guard against errors in the translation. Joost van 
Meter wrote a History of Holland in 1597. In 1875 Van Meters were livino- 
there, respected, educated and wealthy. 

A well known American name is that of the Rev. William C, Van Meter, 
connected at one time with the Five Points' Mission in New York city, after- 
ward the organizer of numerous schools for Italian children in Rome; also

History attests the fact that the seventeenth centun.^ was marked by 
numerous expeditions of settlers from many lands to this countn,-. Their 
homes, their marriages, the births and subsequent scatterings of their chil- 
dren are in evidence, here and there, by such records of ancient religious 
and civic organizations as have been preserved. The baptismal and mar- 
riage registers of the old Dutch church of Kingston, Ulster county, New 
York (formerly named Wiltwych, and familiarly called Esopus or Sopus), 
for one hundred and fifty years from their commencement, in 1660, have 
been transcribed and edited by Rosvvell Randall Hoos. Tliey give glimpses 
of the families which had a part in its history. Van Meteres, Van Maitres and 
Van Meterens are found in connection with two of those great epochs of 
the human race: birth and marriage. The names Delameter, De Lametre, 
etc., in Kingston, as early as 1739, seem to indicate a French branch of the 
family. 

In 1682 Joost Janz (also written Jansen), j. m. (young man), of Meteren. 
in Gelderland, Holland, living then in what is now known as Marbletown, 
Ulster county, New York, was married to Sara Du Bois, j. d. (young woman), 
of Kingston, in the same county. The first publication of the banns was the 
l8th of November. Sara Du Bois was a daughter of Louis Du Bois and 
Katryn (also w-ritten Catr>-n and Catharine) Blanshan, who in turn was the 
daughter of Matthys Blanshan and Madeline Jorisen, of Artois, France. 
Katryn Blanshan married Louis Du Bois (another French Huguenot) at 
Mannheim, Germany, October 10, 1655. The Blanshans, with three of their 
children, came to Esopus, Ulster county. New York, in 1660, in the ship 
Gilded Otter. As it is stated that Louis Du Bois and his wife arrived the 
same year, at the same place, no doubt they came together. 

Among the traditions of that pioneer period is one proving that music 
had charms to soothe the savage American breast. During an absence of 
Louis Du Bois,- his wife, three of the children and others were captured by the 
Indians. The wood upon which Catherine Du Bois had been placed was 
about to be fired when she lifted up her heart in prayer to God and her voice 
in sacred song. Awed by the plaintive tones, her captors delayed their cruel 
purposes to hear more of the strange, sweet sounds. Deliverance came. 
Her husband and his companions, warned by a friendly Indian, rushed upon 
the scene, the Indians fled and the precious lives were saved. Louis and 
Catharine Du Bois were the parents of ten children, seven of them sons. The 
name is still in Ulster county and in many sections of the United States. The 
silver snuff-box, which had been in the familv from the davs of the earliest 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF XEIV JERSEY. 33 

settlers, was recently placed in the Memorial House, at New Paltz, New 
York. A coat of arms is engraved upon its lid. 

Louis Du Bois died in 1696. His widow married a French merchant, 
of Kingston, Jean Cottin (or Cottyn). Under date of September 5th, 1703, 
an interesting entry is found in the book of the old Dutch church, referring 
to Rachel, their slave, aged seventeen years. She had professed her faith 
and received the sacrament of holy baptism; she also promised to serve her 
mistress and master faithfully until their death; afterward she was to be "at 
liberty and free." This is perhaps the first recorded instance in this country 
of the freeing of a slave. 

It is believed there were other children of Joost J. van jNIeteren and Sara 
Du Bois, but the only birth reported, in reply to inquiries, is that of Rebecca, 
baptized April 26, 1686. The sponsors were Gysbert Crom and Catryn Du 
Bois. September 3, 1704, Rebecca Van Meteren was married to Cornelis 
Elting, a son of Jan Elten and Jacomyntje Slecht. A sister and brother by 
the name of Van Meter married a brother and sister by the name of Elting, 
supposed to be Rebecca's brother and the sister of Cornelis. The baptisms 
of three of the children of Cornelis Elting and Rebecca Van Meteren are 
recorded in the Registers of the old Dutch church at Kingston: Isaak, Oc- 
tober 24, 1708; Zara, February 6, 171 5 (Jan Van Meteren one of the four 
sponsors); Alida (Eleanor), May 3, 1724. Sara Elting married John Hite. 
Eleanor Elting married Isaac Hite. and Rebecca Van Meter, daughter of 
Isaac Van Meter, married Abraham Hite (three of the eight children of 
Hans Joost Heydt and Anna Maria Du Bois). As late as 1710-11, the names 
of Van Meter, Elting, Du Bois and Hite— all kindred— were found in King- 
ston, New York. In 1899 no traditions of the Van Meters were obtainable 
in the county: the name was not in the Kingston directory. 

Bommel, in the Netherlands, in the same province of Gelderland, from 
which Joost J. Van Meteren came, was the birthplace, March 10, 1650, of 
Kreijn, a son of Jan Gysbertsen Metrn (as he wrote his name). In 1663 
Kreijn came with his father to New Amsterdam. Although the father used a 
different spelling, in the old records of Kings county. Long Island, and on 
the records of the first Dutch church of Monmouth county. New Jersey, the 
name is spelled Van Metra, Van Metere, Van Meteren and in several other 
ways. The father was well off, financially. In 1673 he was comfortably set- 
tled at New Utrecht, Long Island, and one of the magistrates of that town. 
In 1683 he was a deacon in the Dutch church. There is a tradition that "Jan 
Guysbertsen Metrn" refused to take the oath of allegiance in 1687, and soon 
after went back to his fatherland. But his son, Kreijn Janse, took the oath of 
allegiance to the English government in 1687. He is then mentioned as a 



34 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

resident of New Utrecht. Long Island. In a census of Kings county, taken 
in 1698, his name is spelled "Cryn Jansen," and he has a family of four chil- 
dren. He was married September 9, 1683, to Neeltje (Eleanor), daughter 
of Jan (John) Van Qeef and Engeltje Pietersen. Jan Van Cleef had come 
from Holland in 1653 and settled at New Utrecht in 1659. 

Kreijn Van Matre (a later spelling) and his wife are named among the 
first members and organizers of the Dutch church of Monmouth county, 
New Jersey. He is entered on the church records as "Kriin Jansen," and, in 
1716, when elder, as "Kriin Van Metra." Other children were born in Mon- 
mouth county. The name came to be written Van Mater. Their descend- 
ants were very numerous: some of them are widely scattered and there is no 
uniform way of spelling the surname. Joseph Van Mater, the fifth and 
youngest son, born February 5, 17 10, married Sarah Roelofse Schanck. Of 
their six children only three survived to grow up and marry. 
Joseph lived on and farmed the old homestead where Kreijn Janse first 
settled. The family graveyard is on these premises and reserved forever for 
that purpose by the will of Joseph Van Mater. To this branch of the Van 
Maters Monmouth county is largely indebted for the blooded stock of horses 
for which the county became celebrated during the first half of the present 
century. 

The items in regard to Kreijn Janse Van Mater and his family have been 
gathered from the interesting papers written, under the title of "Early Dutch 
Settlers," by Judge George Crawford Beekman for the "Freehold Tran- 
script." In private letters to the writer of this article, he states his belief that 
the Salem county, New Jersey, and Virginia Van Meters can claim Kreijn 
Janse Van Mater as an ancestor. 

It is not improbable that the Joost Jansen Van Meteren of Ulster county. 
New York, was a son of the Jan Gysbertsen Metrn found in New Utrecht, 
Long Island, — if not a son, a kinsman. The fact that both came from the 
same province, Gelderland, is a confirmation of this theory; and the "History 
of Kingston, New York," by Marius Schoonmaker, shows the close connec- 
tions between the settlers of Ulster county and Long Island. The traditions 
here point to Ulster county, New York, and the associations suggest Joost 
Jansen and Sara Du Bois for ancestors. It has always been understood that 
the families of Monmouth and Salem counties were related. The older gener- 
ations visited each other, but time, with its inevitable changes, brought newer 
and stronger ties. 

No history of the early Van Meters in any of their branches, in any part 
of the United States, presents them other than quiet people, devoted to their 
families, obeying the Scriptural injunction in minding their own business.

lovers and organizers of religious services, believers in education, and own- 
ers of extensive tracts of land and fine horses. These have been characteristic 
traits in Salem countv. The name as first recorded in the clerk's of=fice. at 
Salem, in 1714. is spelled Van Meter, and. ever since, it has appeared the same 
way, with and without the capital M for Meter. 

Between 1712 and 1714 the region now known as Upper Pittsgrove and 
beyond it began to be settled Ijy people from New \'ork. Long Island, New 
England and East Jersev. The fever of emigration was in their blood : it has 
never whollv died out. John and Isaac Van Meter, Jacob Du Bois and his 
sister, Sarah Du Bois, from Ulster county. New York, located three thousand 
acres'of land, purchased, in 1714, from Daniel Cox. of Burlington. New Jer- 
sey. They divided the tract by the compass, the Du Boises taking on the 
north side of the line: the \^an Meters on the south side. Tlie Van Meters 
continued to purchase until they owned a ^•ery large part of the land reach- 
ing from the overshot mill in Upper Alloway's Creek, near Daretown, south- 
erfy southeast to Fork Bridge, about six thousand acres in all, and most of 
the titles to the lands held by the present occupants go back to the Van Meter 
titles. 

A first-class school for that period was established by the new arrivals. 
Some of the most distinguished men of the state in subsequent years were 
proud of the learning obtained by them at the Pittsgrove College, as it was 
termed. John Moore White, an associate justice of the supreme court, and 
also attorney general, was educated there. Religious services (presumably 
after the Dutch Reformed order), and held in private houses and tlie school- 
house, were not neglected. The first house for public wor.ship stood near 
the village of Woodstown. It went down soon after 1740. Tlie date of its 
building and the memor\- of the site have passed away. May 22. 1739. ap- 
plication was made by Isaac Van Meter to the Philadelphia Presbytery in be- 
half of himself and others, for the settlement of the gospel in Piles Grove. 

In May, 1740, the Rev. David Evans, of Tredyffrin. Pennsylvania, began 
to preach to the congregation, and April 30, 1741. a Presbyterian church was 
organized when forty-nine members signed the co\enant and were admittetl 
to the enjoyment of the special ordinances of the gospel. The interesting 
list is taken from the "History of the Presbyterian Church of Pilesgrove, or 
Pittsgrove," in the compilation of which the Rev. Allen H. Brown labored 
assiduously. Mr. Brown is fitly called "a modern Paul." He has been the 
historian of the \\'est Jersey Presbytery, a pastor, a presbyterial and a synod- 
ical missionary. The plan of synodical sustentati(in. the Brainerd me- 
morial fund, the monument to the Rev. John Doyd. unveiled in the old Scots' 
burial <^round. Freehold. New Jersey. June 14. 1900. etc.. are due to him.

He has raised thousands of dollars in the prosecution of his work: his efforts 
in behalf of. Sabbath observance and all his hn-ing', self-denying services of 
more than half a century in New Jersey have been a living testimony to his 
belief in the doctrine that "the chief end of man is to glorify God." 

Signers of the church covenant of the Presbyterian congregation at Piles- 
grove: Isaac Van Meter, Hannah (his wife), Henry Van Meter ("their son).

known as "the old church" was erected in 1767. The new church, opposite 
the parsonage, was dedicated August 11, 1867. 

John Van Meter's name does not appear in the covenant. He evidently 
went to Virginia after locating land in Salem county. According to the Hon. 
W. S. Laidley, of Charleston, West Virginia, a local historian, the first white 
people to traverse "the Valley of Virginia" were John and Isaac Van Metre. 
In 1725 John Van Metre is with the Delaware Indians on the hunt of the 
Catawbas. In 1730 both are in Williamsburg, where they took a council 
order for forty thousand acres of land, to settle the same by colony, etc. In 
his "Sketches of Virginia," Dr. Foote states that "Isaac Van Meter, the 
founder of Fort Pleasant, came to the South Branch of the Potomac in the 
year 1740, in company with some Cayuga Indians and laid a tomahawk right 
on what has been known for the last century as the Old Fields; he went back 
to his home and, in 1744, he moved there with his family." 

A copy of the will of Isaac Van Metre "of the South Branch of Potow- 
mach in the county of Frederick, Virginia," made February 15, 1754, is re- 
corded at Trenton, New Jersey (Liber 12, 1763-1768). It was presented at 
court held in Hampshire county, Virginia, by Henry and Garret Van Metre, 
surviving executors, December 14, 1757. They qualified before the Salem 
county surrogate November 30, 1758 (where the name is written Van Meter). 
The will provides for his "dear wife, Hannah, as long as she shall live," and 
mentions the following children: Henry, Jacob, Garret, Sarah (the wife of

known of any of Henry's chikhen and their nmnerous descendants except 
tlie line of Benjamin. He was horn in Octoher, 1744, and was the son of 
the last wife, Mary Le Fevre, a daughter of Erasmus Le Fevre (afterward 
corrupted to Fetters), a French Huguenot who with his wife emigrated 
about 1683 to Salem from England, whither they had tied. Others of the 
name became celebrated in England as chemists, physicians, silk manufac- 
turers, etc. "The history of the Le Fevres in the. United States'" (or a 
similar title), by Ralph Le Fevre, of Xew Paltz, Xew York, is soon to be 
published. The Erasmus Le Fe\re and his wife who came to Salem (be- 
lieved to Ije of the same family as Hypolite Le Fevre), were members of 
the Society of Friends. Tliey had six children: Erasmus, Thomas. Sarah, 
Mar}'. Hannah and another daughter \\ hose name is not given. Thomas 
Shourds, in his "History of Fenwick's Colony." has traced a part of their

His commi.ssion as Captain was given l)y Governor Franklin .\pril 22. 1773. 
He died September 19. 1773, aged forty-eight years. He was a son of 
Captain James Dunlap, Sr., of Penn's Neck. The Dunlaps (Protestant) came 
from Ireland to Delaware, thence to Salem count}', where they began to 
purchase property in lAgj. The senior Dunlap died in 1758. His will

township, where he died, leaving a widow and two daughters, — Anne and 
Mary. He is believed to be a descendant of the colonial governor of the same 
name. The Hunters were distinguished for their prominence in the pulpit 
and state offices and for their learning and eloquence. ^Mary Hunter married 
Samuel Purviance, a merchant of Philadelphia. They iiad one son, Samuel,

scendants at this date (1900). Mary married ^Matthew Newkirk; Erasmus, 
Mary Burroughs; Bathsheba married W'ilham ]\Iayhe\v. James and Robert 
Hunter became identified with Salem. 

James Van Meter, the oldest child of Benjamin and Bathsheba (Dunlaii) 
Van Meter, was boni May 12, 1767, was educated at the Pittsgrove College, 
studied under Dr. Harris, a noted physician in the locality, attended lectures 
at the University of Pennsylvania in 1789, was examined by Drs. Scott and 
Sayre, of Burlington, New Jersey, licensed by two justices of the supreme 
court and admitted to practice his profession May 5, 1790. After a year at 
Hancock's Bridge, he came to Salem, where he had an extensive practice 
until his death, January 26, 1847. H!is biographer says: "No physician, I 
believe, ever lived in this county possessing a more spotless reputation, nor 
did there ever die one more sincerely regretted. In his professional and 
private life he was a blessing and an ornament to the community." He was 
a surgeon in the war of 18 12 (in the locality). He was one of the founders 
of the Presbyterian church in Salem, united with it in 1824, and was chosen 
for a ruling elder in 1828. He bequeathed the Dunlap farm, inherited from 
his mother, to the church. He married Ruth Jones, a daughter of Thomas 
Jones, a leading business man and a Revolutionary hero, March 14, 1798. 
Mrs. Ruth Jones Van Meter was the first treasurer of the Female Benevolent 
Society, organized in 18 17, and the first superintendent of the Presbyterian 
Sabbath-school, organized in 1824. 

Their only child, Thomas Jones Van Meter, born Februar}^ 25, 1799, 
after a classical education at the college of New Jersey, in Princeton, gradu- 
ated as a physician in Philadelphia, but he never practiced outside of the 
family owing to deafness, giving his attention to reading and the care of his 
inherited estates. He married Hannah Foster Keasbey, daughter of Anthony 
and Hannah Keasbey, of Salem, April 12, 1826. Mrs. Hannah Van Meter 
took a lively interest in social and church affairs. She died in March, 1871. 
Dr. Thomas Jones Van Meter died August 14, 1885. There were four chil- 
dren by this marriage,- — Thomas Jones, Artemisia Keasbey, Martha Jones 
and James Anthony. The first child died in his infancy, the last in his child- 
hood. The daughters were prominent, socially, in the years of their strength, 
active in the work of the town, particularly during the civil war, in the Ladies' 
Aid Society, but they have been especially distinguished for private benevo- 
lence and attachment to the Presbyterian church, with which they united. 
Miss Artemisia Keasbey Van Meter died January 16, 1900. Her sister. Miss 
Martha Jones Van Meter, is the only living descendant of Dr. James and 
Ruth (Jones) \'an Meter. Her home is still in the house built on property, 
inherited by her mother, in the Keasbey family from 1709, and the Jones

and Van Meter estates have never been sold. Few families in the county 
or in the country have retained ownership and occupancy of land for so 
many years. The tenure of tenants has been more like the English than the 
usual American custom. 

Robert Hunter Van Meter, the seventh child of Benjamin and Bathsheba 
(Dunlap) Van Meter, was born on his father's farm November 29, 1778, and 
educated at the Pittsgrove College. He studied medicine in the office of his 
brother. Dr. James Van Meter, in Salem, and spent his winters in Phila- 
delphia, attending lectures. Certificates were given him by Drs. Benjamin 
Rush and James Woodhouse, of the University of Pennsylvania, in March, 
1800, and Drs. James Stratton and Ebenezer Elmer, of Bridgeton, New Jer- 
sey. He received his license, as a physician and surgeon, from the supreme 
court June 10, 1800, and began his professional life in Pittsgrove. He mar- 
ried Rachel Burroughs, of the same place, who lived only three months. His 
second wife was Sarah Leake \\'hitaker, a daughter of Ambrose and Rachel 
(Leake) Whitaker. They were married November 21, 1804. He came with 
his family to Salem in March, 1810. In the war of 1812 he was drafted to go 
to Canada, but he was transferred to the care of the sick and wounded of 
the regiment then stationed at Salem for the protection of the Delaware and 
its branches. "The old jail at the corner" — an expression familiar to former 
generations — was used as a hospital. Dr. Robert Hunter Van Meter held 
various offices and represented his county in the state legislature. He was 
a man of scientific tastes and of much intellectual vigor. His practice was 
I large and attended by much exposure, but he was untiring, by night and 
day, often himself more ill than his patients. He has the honor of being 
the first resident Presbyterian in Salem, having united with the church of 
that faith in Pittsgrove. He was one of the founders of the Salem Presby- 
terian church in 1821, one of the first elders chosen, the same year, and re- 
markably devoted to it, giving, as has been said, his time, prayers and money 
with cordial zeal and affection. It was he who collected four hundred dol- 
lars in one day toward the erection of a building, a large sum for the period 
and people interested. He died March 14, 1839, after a short but severe 
illness. His wife died August 18, 1841, in her sixtieth year. 

Of their eight children three — James, Robert and Josiah — died in their 
infancy. The five who lived to maturity were Emma. Mary, Edward, ]\Iason 
and Harriet. Emma, born September 25, 1805, rendered an important ser- 
vice to the future historians of the Salem Presbyterian church. She began, 
at the request of her father, its history from the time of the laying of the 
corner-stone, with such antecedent facts relating to the churches of Penn's 
Neck and Logtow n as slie could gather. She was then sixteen vears of age.

Her impartial account of its rise and progress witli biographical sketches of 
the pastors was continued to 1856. Miss Emma Van Meter died near Balti- 
more, Maryland, November 15, 1869. Mary Van Meter, born March 2, 
1808. married Enos R. Pease, of Connecticut, April 6, 1833. She died April 
17, 1834, leaving an infant son, Alvin Robert, who died at Allegheny City. 
Pennsylvania, in 1851. Although so young, he was the organist in a church 
there and had composed a piece of music to which he gave the name of 
Salem. 

Edward Van Meter, born November 25, 181 1, was educated in the excel- 
lent private schools (taught by clergj-men) for which Salem was then noted. 
He began the study of law in the oi^ce of Francis L. Macculloch, but before 
his studies were completed he abandoned them for mercantile pursuits. In 
1848, he was unanimously elected a justice of the peace and continued to be 
re-elected until he declined to serve. He finally returned to the study of law, 
finishing his course under Alphonso L. Eakin and was admitted to the bar 
in 1864. 

The "History of Salem County" gives the following pen picture: "Per- 
haps no man was better known in Salem county than Edward Van Meter; 
for, during an unusually busy life as student, merchant, magistrate and law- 
yer, most of which was passed in his native place, the public eye was con- 
stantly upon him. His intercourse with all classes of people was such that he 
may be said to have been an encyclopedia of the public affairs of Salem 
county, and he was thoroughly posted on the status of every business man. 
As a lawyer, his practice was large; not as an advocate in the courts, for 
deafness, with which he had been afflicted for many years, precluded such 
public efforts, but in his office, where clients constantly solicited his advice 
and counsel. In real estate and agricultural matters his judgment was al- 
ways sought, and few men in the county knew as well as he the values of 
the various plantations for production and in\^estment. He was prompt 
and correct in business, keen in judgment, (|uick in action, energetic in his 
every movement, self-assured in his ventures, and thus a type of the rare class 
of men who depend upon themselves. A love of good horses, a family trait, 
was one of his prominent characteristics, and his name is well known to 
the horsemen of the country through his correspondence with Mr. J. H. Wal- 
lace. His knowledge of the local horse history of West and South Jersev 
was wonderfully extensive and accurate." He died January 4, 1875. 

He married Caroline Whitaker, of Deerfield, Cumberland county, New 
Jersey, a daughter of Isaac Whitaker, Esq., and Ann Fithian, December 14, 
1847. Mrs. Van Meter is still living. Their children are Mary Caroline, 
Harriet F. and Anna Hunter, all of whom have been with their mother

Mr. Cone died in New York city, December 6. 1888, and in a few months 
Mrs. Cone returned to Salem. She is a woman of rare mental gifts, shown 
in her linguistic and artistic attainments, ability as a writer and her conver- 
sational charms, for she retains much of the vivacity of her youth. She re- 
members seeing the old Dutch clock that came from Holland, brought by 
the early Van Meters to Salem county, of which no trace can now be found. 
In her eightieth year, she has been engaged in helping to write and collect 
biographical sketches of the Salem county contributors to "The New Jersey 
Scrap Book," which was compiled by Mrs. Margaret T. Yardley, and pub- 
lished in 1893. by the State Board of Women ^Managers for the World's Fair. 
Of Mrs. Cone's numerous literary compositions, none has given more pleas- 
ure to her friends than "Saturday Night in Salem," written in 1896. All the 
local flavor is in it, told in her own sprightly style. 

She has survived both her children: Norris Hunter, born May 2, 1830. 
and Charles Kirtland. born December 30, 185 1. The latter, a very winsome 
child, died in Gaylordsville, Connecticut, June 22. i860. Her first born died 
in Denver, Colorado, June 15. 1899. On the previous 21st of March he had 
married Madge McBrayer Morgan. Norris Hunter Cone went to Colorado 
after his graduation at Lafayette College, Easton. Pennsylvania, in 1872, to 
practice his profession of mining engineer, in which he rose to eminence. He 
could scent valuable ore and. through his inventive genius, he was able to 
make needed improvements to the machinery used in the crushing mills. 
His death was a great loss to the mining interests in this country. As an 
expert, he was in demand everywhere. His judgment in selecting workmen, 
his tact in dealing with them, his human kindness to them, and his devotion 
to whatever he undertook made him a great reliance. His sudden removal 
left a vacancy which those who had leaned upon him said could never be 
filled.

whose fair face appears no sign of blot; and he should thus be the more 
honored who honors a noble name and the memory of noble deeds. The line- 
age of the subject of this review is one of distinguished and interesting order, 
and no apology need be made in reverting to this in connection with the 
individual accomplishments of the subject himself. 

The Hilliard family is of French-Huguenot extraction and has had an 
American setting of several generations, its identification with the New 
World dating back to the early colonial epoch. Fleeing from their native 
land to escape the impious persecutions incident to the revocation of the 
Edict of Nantes, the original Huguenot ancestors left France during the 
reign of Louis XHI and sought refuge in England, where the name has 
ever since had honored representatives, and whence came the original Ameri- 
can stock. In this country the foundation of the Hilliard family antedates 
the settlement of Pennsylvania by Penn and that of New Jersey under the 
English proprietors. Thus the name is one of the oldest and most honored 
in the annals of American histor}*, and the sterling characteristics of those 
l)earing the name in the various generations may be clearly recognized when 
we revert to the fact that they have been identified with that noble, religious 
body, the Society of Friends, whose verj^ existence has been at all times an 
example of unassuming worth and deepest humanitarianism. As a family 
the Hilliarfls have been notable for inflexible integrity, firmness, consistencv. 
ability and thrift. 

John Hilliard, the emigrant ancestor, came to America from London, 
England, prior to 1680, locating in Sussex county, Delaware, which section 
w as then a portion of Pennsylvania. He was a man of marked intellectuality 
and was an influential factor in the affairs of the colonies, having been one 
of the three county judges summoned by William Penn to meet him at Up- 
land (now Chester), Pennsylvania, in 1682, and he was a member of the first 
provincial council of Pennsylvania, which met at Philadelphia in 1683. His 
son John, born in 1659, had previously crossed the Delaware river to New- 
Jersey, and there, about the year 1680, he was united in marriage to Martha, 
the only daughter of Barnard W. Devonish, who was one of the New Jersey 
proprietors and a large land-owner. Of this marriage six children were born, 
of whom the eldest was Edward, who married Sarah Haines, who bore him 
nine children. Samuel, the fifth child of Edward and Sarah (Haines) Hilliard, 
married Hannah Atkinson and they became the parents of six children. 
They took up their abode in Salem county. New Jersey, and the family name 
has ever since been conspicuously identified with this section of the state. 
Joseph Hilliard, the sixth child of Samuel and Hannah Hilliard, married Ann 
Thompson, and they made their home in Salem county. He was a carpenter

by trade, and was known as an lionest, industrious and pious man, being a 
birthright and life member of the Society of Friends. Joseph and Ann Hil- 
hard became the parents of six children: John A.; Thomas T., the father of 
the subject of this sketch; Mary, who died unmarried; Hannah, who married 
Joseph E. Moore; Atkinson, who died in childhood; and Rebecca, who mar- 
ried Benjamin Griscom. 

Thomas T. Milliard, the second son of Joseph and Ann Hilliard, is one of 
the venerable and most highly honored citizens of Salem county, where his 
entire life has been passed. He was born in Mannington township, on the 
3d of September, 1816. He received his educational training in the puljlic 
schools, after which he fitted himself for the practical duties of life by learning 
the trade of carpenter, thus following in the footsteps of his father. Shortly 
after his marriage, however, he turned his attention to the manufacturing 
of lime, conducting operations eventually upon an extensive scale and at- 
taining success through well directed effort and honorable dealing. In 1870 
he retired from this enterprise, having accumulated considerable property. 
He has since devoted his attention to the management of his real-estate and 
other property interests, and though advanced in years retains his mental 
and physical powers to a marked degree. He has been a prominent and pub- 
lic-spirited citizen of Salem county, in whose development and material pros- 
perity he has ever maintained a lively interest. He is now accounted one of 
the patriarchs of the county, and no man is held in higher esteem than this 
representative of one of the old colonial families of the nation. Like his an- 
cestors, he has been a zealous and devoted member of the Society of Friends. 

On the 5th of July, 1843, was solemnized the marriage of Thomas T. Hil- 
liard and Miss Hannah Townsend Goodwin, and they became the parents of 
four children, of whom the first two died in infancy. The two surviving chiU 
dren are William T., whose name initiates this review; and Jo.«eph Bernard. 
A brief record of the genealog)' of the' Goodwin family will be consistent 
at this juncture: 

The American progenitor of the Goodwin family with which this article 
has to do was John Goodwin, who was born in 1680, the son of John and 
Catherine Goodwin, residents of the parish of St. Buttolph, in Aldgate, Lon- 
don. He came to Pennsylvania in 1701, and removed thence, within the suc- 
ceeding year, to Salem county. New Jersey, from which fact it may be seen 
that the subject of this review is identified with two of the oldest families in 
this commonwealth. This pioneej resident married Susanna, a daughter of 
John Smith, of Hedgefield, Mannington township, and their children were 
six in number, as follows: John, born February 29, 1707; Mary, born Sep- 
tember I, 1710; Joseph, born No\ember 21. 1713: John (2d), born October 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEIV JERSEY. 47 

17, 1716; Thomas, born June 10. 1721 ; and William, born August 25, 1723. 
' Thomas Goodwin married Sarah Morris, a daughter of Lewis and Sarah 
(Fetters) Morris, and he eventually removed from Salem to Elsinboro, in 
the same county, where he erected a brewery upon his wife's homestead 
farm, which she had inherited. They disposed of this property in 1756 and 
subsequently purchased residence property on Broadway, in the town of 
Salem, where they maintained their home until the death of Mrs. Goodwm, 
which'occurred on the 5th of October, 1765, when she had arrived at the age 
of forty-one years. Mr. Goodwin subsequently consummated a second mar- 
riage, being united to Sarah Smith, who died May 25, 1783. aged f^fty-three 
years'. Thomas Goodwin lived to attain the venerable age of eighty-two, his 
death occurring in 1803. He was a man of strong mental and physical pow- 
ers and was an influential citizen of the county. 

The youngest son of John and Susanna (Smith) Goodwin was Wdliam 
Goodwin, born in 1723, who figures as the direct progenitor of the numerous 
and estimable Goodwin family in Salem county at the present day. He married 
Mary a daughter of Lewis and Sarah (Fetters) Morris, and they had f^ve chil- 
dren,-^John, Susanna, Lewis, William and Mary. Mr. Goodwin was a carpen- 
ter by trade, but he finally abandoned work in this line to engage in farming. 
His wife died April 3, 1776. Their son John was born June 19. 1745- and 
married Ann, a daughter of Clement and Margaretta (Morris) Hall, of Elsin- 
boro township. Clement Hall was the son of William Hall, Jr., of Manning- 
ton township, and a grandson of Judge William Hall, a distinguished citizen 
of Salem in bygone days. John Goodwin and Ann Hall were second cousins, 
and after a courtship of eight years were finally allowed to marry, though con- 
trary to the discipline of the Society of Friends, of which they were birth- 
right members. This was the first marriage of the sort ever sanctioned by 
the society. Mr. Goodwin was uniformly respected for his integrity and 
piety. He died about 1792. 

Lewis Goodwin, the second son of William and Mary (Morris) Goodwin, 
was born November 9. 1748. and by his marriage to Rebecca Zanes he had 
two children,— John and Susan. After the death of his first wife he married 
Abi-ail a daughter of William and Elizabeth Carpenter, this union bemg 
cons\immated in 1807, and the result thereof being three sons,— Morris, Wil- 
liam and Thomas. After his second marriage Lewis Goodwin removed to 
Ohio where his wife died, in 1819, after which he returned to Salem, where 
he passed the remainder of his life. William, the second son by the second 
marriage, married Huldah Townsend, a daughter of Daniel Townsend, of 
Cape May county. New Jersey, and their children were Rachel, Lewis, 
Hannah, William and Mary. Of these Hannah became the wife of Thomas

T. Hilliard, as has already been noted, and was the mother of the subject 
of this sketch. She died January 17, 1897, at the age of seventy-seven years. 

WilHam T. Hilliard, whose ancestral history has been outHned in the 
preceding paragraphs, was the third in order of birth of the four children 
of Thomas Townsend and Hannah H. (Goodwin) Hilliard. He was born in 
Elsinboro township, Salem county, on the 28th of May, 1849. His more pure- 
ly literary training was secured in the Salem Academy and in the academy 
conducted by Swithin C. Shortledge, at Kenneth Square, Chester county, 
Pennsylvania. Prior to leaving school he had formulated definite plans for his 
future, having determined to prepare himself for the legal profession. 
Accordingly he entered the law office of Hon. Clement H. Sinnickson, of 
Salem, with whom he continued his specific or technical reading for a time, 
after which he was under the effective preceptorship of that eminent jurist 
and legist. Judge Thomas P. Carpenter, of Camden, who was a justice of 
the supreme court of the state. In 1873 Mr. Hilliard was admitted to the 
bar of New Jersey as an attorney at law, and in 1877 he secured admission 
as a counselor. He forthwith entered upon the active practice of his pro- 
fession in Salem, and he has been eminently successful in his chosen field 
of endeavor, retaining a distinctively representative clientage and having 
been concerned in much of the important litigation in this section of the 
state; also appearing very frequently in the higher courts in connection 
with causes of much moment. His success as a practitioner is the best 
evidence of his ability, and many of the more important cases in which he 
has been interested may be found in the New Jersey law and equity reports. 

Mr. Hilliard is known as one of the most progressive, alert and public- 
spirited citizens of Salem, and his aid and influence are granted to every 
worthy cause projected in the public interest. He is identified with several 
important enterprises of a local order, among which it may be mentioned 
that he was one of the incorporators of the City National Bank of Salem, 
which was founded in 1888 and of which he is the president and also counsel, 
the institution being very successful. He was one of the incorporators of the 
Salem Cemetery Association, which was organized in 1886, for the purpose 
of establishing a public cemetery of proper character, and he has served as 
its treasurer. Through the efforts of this association a beautiful cemetery, 
comprising sixteen acres, has been laid out in appropriate design, beautified 
and cared for as "God's acre" should be in every community. ]Mr. Hilliard 
was prominently concerned in the establishing of the Salem Electric Light 
Company, of which he sen'ed as treasurer for nine years, when he resigned 
the office.

50 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



DR. WILLIAM H. CARPENTER. 

Dr. William Howard Carpenter, a prominent physician of Salem, New 
Jersey, is a son of William Beasley and Nancy A. (Pease) Carpenter, and was 
born on February i6, 1871, in the township of Elsinboro, this county. He 
comes from a long line of illustrious ancestors who have borne a prominent 
part in the development of this state and left him the heritage of a goodly 
name, which he bears in a manner befitting a descendant of Joshua and Sam- 
uel Carpenter. He attended the district school in his youth but early decided 
to enter one of the professions, and with this end in view laid the foundation 
for his subsequent career by obtaining a substantial education. Graduating 
at the Salem high school, he entered the University of Pennsylvania, at 
which, in 1892, he graduated as an M. D. Following that he had two years' 
hospital practice, serving fifteen months as a resident physician in the Phila- 
delphia Hospital, four months in St. Mary's and St. Agnes' Hospital and four 
months in the out-door department of the Pennsylvania University Hospital. 
He came to Salem in 1893 and began the practice of his profession, taking a 
special course in the Polyclinic Hospital of Philadelphia on diseases of the 
throat and nose, and making a specialty of these diseases in his practice. 
Close application to his profession has been rewarded by a large and lucrative 
practice, and he is ranked to-day among the leading physicians of Salem 
county. 

Dr. Carpenter was united in the holy bonds of matrimony, on October 16, 
1895, to Miss Jane Eliza, a daughter of Daniel and Elizabeth Whitney, who 
has charge of the National Cemetery at Finn's Point, this state. They have 
one child, William B., Jr. 

The Doctor is a Republican. For four years he served the county as the 
physician of the Salem County Almshouse. He is a member of the Ameri- 
can Medical Association, the Salem County Medical Association and was 
formerly a member of the D. Hayes Agnew Surgical Society. He was one 
of the leaders in athletic sports when in college, being a member of the track 
team of the university for two years. He was also a member of the boating 
club, rowing in the freshman and class crews. 

He is a member of Excelsior Lodge, No. 54, F. & A. M.; Brearley Chap- 
ter, R. A. M.. at Bridgeton; Fenwick Lodge, No. 7, K. of P.; Fenwick 
Lodge, I. O. O. F.; and also the Fenwick and Garfield Clubs. He was the 
coroner of the county from 1896 to 1899, is one of the board of directors of 
the Y. M. C. A., and vice-president of the board of education, of which he has 
been a member for the past five years. He is a member of the Salem County

Frank Richards and John V., Jr. In politics Mr. Craven is an independent 
Democrat and exhibits a high degree of intelligence in forming his opinion 
on national affairs, as in business matters. He represented the west ward 
in the city council four years, was a member of the Board of Trade, and 
is a member of the present Board of Education. He takes an active interest 
in any subject relative to the welfare of the city, and has made for himself 
an enviable reputation for his business sagacity and good judgment. He 
has accumulated a considerable property and takes the best way of enjoying 
it, — by helping those who are trying honestly to get a start in life and have no 
means to aid them. Many young persons have received from this worthy 
gentleman timely and unostentatious assistance, which has started them on 
the road to success, where they could never have hoped to travel by their own 
unaided efforts, and their gratitude is a living monument to his benevolent 
deeds. 



S. H. STANGER. 



Hon. S. H. Stanger, state senator from Gloucester county and a leading 
merchant of Glassboro, New Jersey, was born near this village, March 22. 
1836. His father, Solomon H. Stanger, was also a native of this vicinity and 
was a son of Jacob Stanger, who was one of seven brothers, — Jacob, Solo- 
mon, John, Christian, Adam. Francis and Philip. These, with one sister, 
Sophia, came from Holland to this country and worked at the Wistar Glass 
Works in Alloway Creek township, Salem count}-. They settled in Glassboro 
in 1775 and built the glass works here. 

Solomon H. Stanger learned the glass-blower's trade, at which he worked 
and also engaged in farming. He was one of the foremost farmers of his 
time and made great progress in agricultural affairs. He was a prominent 
member of the Protestant Methodist church and held all of its offices, at 
different times. He was also prominent in the Independent Order of Odd 
Fellows, taking an active part in their meetings. He was public spirited to

a de-ree losing no opportunity to advance the welfare of the community. 
He married a ladv whose maiden name was Hannah Simmerman. a daughter 
of John Simmerman. She passed to her reward in 1883. and he on Apnl 6. 
1887 leaving a familv of four children to mourn their death. 

To obtain an education our subject attended the public schools of his 
native place until he was twenty-one, when he left school and began fann- 
ino- The first two vears he worked for his father and then purchased the 
farm This vocation was continued until 1880. when he rented a buildmg 
and opened a store in this village. The following year he moved into a 
larger building, the famous old "Temperance House." now occupied by hun, 
where he has one of the largest and most complete stocks of goods to be 
found in this part of the country. At one time he was connected with the 
Gran-e acting as its agent, and he still retains all his old-time interest in the 
farming element. He is a remarkably shrewd business man. but thoroughly 
honest and upright in all his dealings, and his conduct is beyond question. 
He was married^in iSCo to ^lis's Lydia B. Shute. a daughter of Isaac Shute 
and their only children are two sons.— C. Fleming and Frank R.,— both of 
whom are able assistants of their father in the store. 

Mr. Stanger is a stanch Republican and has been chosen by his friends to 
fill several of^ces of various importance. He was elected freeholder in 1885 
and held that place continuously for ten years, ser^dng at the same time as 
the treasurer of the almshouse conmiittee. In 1892 he was elected to the 
assemblv and was an incumbent of that ofifice four years, one year longer 
than an'v previous member from that county had held it, and it was sorely 
ao-ainst his will that he was nominated the last time, but his fnends insisted 
and he was obliged to vield to their wishes. In 1896 he was elected to the 
state senate, and here he has done all in his power for the general good 
and has upheld the high standard his constituents placed for him. He has 
ever been a friend of the laboring man and has striven to lighten their load 
whenever practicable. During the session of 1898-9 he introduced and 
worked for the passage of an act compelling the payment of wages at least 
once in two weeks. He succee.led in getting this bill through the senate, 
but it was killed in the house. This bill was intended to compel the glass 
companies to pay their employes cash and not force them to patronize the 
companies' stores, as had been done before. Mr. Stanger was in no sense a 
politician, as he never made promises of what he would do, and was not a 
wire puller or schemer for office. His record has been pure and clean and 
will readilv admit the searchlight of Truth to be turned on at every point. 
He is a director of the Glassboro Building & Loan Association and takes 
pride in the institutions of the town. 



54 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

He is connected with x'arions fraternal societies and ranks liigh in them. 
In 1867 he was made an Odd Fellow and has passed all the chairs. In 1875 
he was elected secretary of the Glassboro Lodge, No. 58, and is still an in- 
cumbent. He is a member of Fraternal Encampment, Xo. 23, I. O. O. F., 
of Woodbury, and was made a Mason in 1882, in Glassboro Lodge, No. 55, 
and in that also he has passed all the chairs. He later joined Trenton Chap- 
ter, Gebal Council, and Palestine Commandery, No. 4, Trenton. He is a 
thirty-second-degree Mason, belonging to the Consistory at Camden, and is 
also a Shriner, belonging to Lulu Temple, of Philadelphia. In 1895 l^^ joined 
Pocahontas Council. Xo. 48, of the Junior Order of American Mechanics. 
He is prominent in church work, as a member of the Methodist Episcopal 
church, and has been a trustee and steward for years. His popularity is 
shown by the large majority received b\- him when a candidate for election 
to public office. 



THOMAS \V. TRENCHARD. 

The name of Trenchard has figured conspicuously in connection with 
public affairs of New Jersey for several generations, and he of whom we 
W'rite has added new luster to the family record by his honorable career. He 
was born in Centerton, Salem county, X^ew Jersey, December 13, 1863. and 
now- resides in Bridgeton, Cumberland county. He is a lineal descendant 
of George Trenchard, who came from east Jersey and settled in Salem county 
in 1720. His paternal great-grandfather, John Trenchard, resided in Fair- 
field township, Cumberland county, where for a number of years he success- 
fully engaged in the operation of a gristmill, in vessel building and shipping 
of lumber, acquiring thereby a handsome competence. He was a public- 
spirited man and a recognized leader in the community, and at one time a 
member of the legislative council of New Jersey. 

Twice married, one of his children, James Howell Trenchard. was born 
in Fairfield township, Cumberland county, on May 20, 181 1, and became 
one of the early civil engineers and land surveyors of this section of the 
state. He attended school at Easton, Pennsylvania, under Rev. Dr. George 
Junkin. During his early manhood he resided in Centerton, Salem county, 
but afterward took up his abode at Bridgeton. He was actively connected 
with various business enterprises, and in connection with his work as civil 
engineer conducted a mercantile establishment and also owned and operated 
saw and grist mills. He gave his political support to the Whig party until 
its dissolution, when he joined the ranks of the new Republican party and 
was one of its stalwart supporters until his death. He served as a member 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEIV JERSEY. 55 

of the citv council of the city of Bridgeton. and also represented Salem 
county in'the state legislature, bemg elected to that body in the year 1848, 
on the Whig ticket. His sound judgment and patriotic spirit made him par- 
ticularly popular and efficient in public office, and his efforts in behalf of 
the general welfare were very effective. He married Miss Mary Barrett, a 
daughter of William Barrett, at one time a merchant of Fairton, New Jersey 
She is still living, at the advanced age of ninety years, but Mr. Trenchard 
has passed away, having died after a brief illness, February 27, 1877. 1" their 
familv were seven children. Richard, the eldest, born December 11 1838, 
was ihree times married, his first union being ^^-ith Emily \\ hitaker, by 
whom he had three children.-Elizabeth, Mary and Herbert. His second 
wife was Mary Hitchner. bv whom he had two children,-Joseph and Delia. 
For his third wife he chose Eva Breese. As a means of livelihood he en- 
gaged in manufacturing, in Bridgeton. William B. was the second of the 
family James W., born September 17. 1843. ^vas twice married, and by the 
first union, with Miss Gertrude Bond, had one son. Frank. For his second 
wife he chose Amanda Powell. He was one of the organizers and is at 
present the cashier of the Bridgeton National Bank. Eleanor, bom Septem- 
ber 10 1848, is the wife of James T. Williams, a tinware manufacturer of" 
Philadelphia, and they have had three children. Alice P., Joseph H and 
Tames T. Jeannetta, born November 10, 1851, is the wife of Charles R 
Elmer, of Bridgeton, New Jersey, and they have two children. Thomas W. 
was born August 18, 1846, and died June 7, i860. Araminta, born February 
10, 1856, died February 27, 1857. 

William B Trenchard. the father of our subject, has for more than a 
quarter of a century been a resident of Bridgeton and has figured conspicu- 
ously in connection with pul,lic affairs. His birth occurred m Centerton 
Salem county. October i. 1840, and after attaining his majority he removed 
to Fairton. where he engaged in general merchandising. About 1870 he 
came to Bridgeton, where he joined his father in the surveying business 
under the firm name of James H. & William B. Trenchard. Upon his father s 
death he continued the business alone and was actively connected with the 
profession until elected county clerk of Cumberland county. For many 
years he served as city surveyor, resigning on his election to the clerkship. 
He was also a justice of the peace for several terms and represented the 
Fourth Ward of Bridgeton on the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Cumber- 
land county, where he was soon recognized as a leader in the conduct o the 
affairs of the county. That office he also resigned nn hen elected county clerk. 
As a surveyor he did much work in Cumberland. Salem, Gloucester, Camden, 
Cape May and Atlantic counties. He surveyed the great tract of Atlantic 



56 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

county, known as the "Walker tract," and also the big section of country 
where Carmel is now located. In addition to his wide knowledge of the 
country acc|uired in this way and the fund of information which he has gained 
through personal experience, and which cannot be acquired from books or 
records, he came into possession upon his father's death of some very valu- 
able papers, maps and other writings which cannot be secured in any other 
place. In 1889 he was elected county clerk of Cumberland county for a term 
of five years, and on the expiration of that period was again chosen to the 
office. At the first election he received a plurality of three hundred and 
fifty-nine votes, and in 1894 his plurality over the Democratic candidate was 
twenty-seven hundred and nine, — a fact which indicates how well he had 
discharged his duty during the first term, thus winning the confidence and 
support of the public. He is a man of sterling worth, very earnest and con- 
scientious in the discharge of his duty, and during his long connection with 
Cumberland county he has won the respect of his fellow men in all the rela- 
tions of Hfe. 

Thomas Wdiitaker Trenchard. whose name introduces this review, was 
born in Centerton, Salem county, on the 13th of December, 1863, and at the 
usual age entered the public school in which he was graduated when fifteen 
years of age. He then entered the South Jersey Institute and was graduated 
in 1882. Thus well equipped for the practical and responsible duties of life 
and with a broad general knowledge to serve as a foundation upon which 
to rear the superstructure of professional wisdom, he began reading law in 
the ofiice of Potter & Nixon, in September, 1882, and was admitted to the 
bar at the November term of the supreme court, in 1886, being licensed a 
counselor of law in 1889. In the former year he located in Bridgeton, where 
he opened an ofifice, since which time he has steadily added to his reputation 
as an able representative of the legal profession. His knowledge of the law 
is comprehensive and thorough, and his application of its principles to the 
points in litigation is very accurate, so that he is fully competent to discharge 
the duties of judge of Cumberland county, to which position he was ap- 
pointed by Governor Vorhees, in April, 1899. On the bench he has added 
to the high reputation he had previously won, and although he is the young- 
est law judge in the state his prestige is creditable and enviable. He served 
as city solicitor of Bridgeton and has held other offices, having in 1888 been 
the nominee of the Republican party for assemblyman. He was elected to 
represent the first district by a plurality of six hundred and three votes, and 
was the youngest member of the house, being at that time only twenty-four 
years of age. The following year he declined to be a candidate for renomi- 
nation, preferring to devote his attention entirely to his law practice. The

position of citv solicitor, however, being" in the direct Hne of his professional 
duties, he accepted the office in the spring of 1892 and continued thereni 
until 1899, when he was elevated to the bench. He was one of the organ- 
izers of the Cumberland County Bar Association, of which he is now servmg 
as the president, and is one of the charter members of the State Bar Associa- 
tion. 

In politics Judge Trenchard has always been a stalwart Republican and 
for four years he ser\-ed as a member of the state central committee. In 
1896 he was chosen one of the presidential electors and represented his con- 
stituents by casting his ballot for McKinley and Hobart. He was also a 
soHcitor of the board of health of Bridgeton for several years, and is a mem- 
ber of the Society of the Sons of the Revolution. 

In November, 1892, Mr. Trenchard was married to Miss Harriet A. Man- 
ning, a daughter of Rev. Dr. Joseph K. Manning, of Trenton, New Jersey, 
who for many years was a Baptist clergyman of that place. The Judge and 
his wife have a wide acquaintance in the southern section of the state and 
enjoy the warm regard of their many friends, to whom they extend a gracious 
hospitality in their pleasant home. 



OWEN L. JONES. 



To this gentleman is due that tribute of respect and admiration which is 
always given— and justlv so— to those men who have worked their way 
upward to positions of prominence through their own efforts, who have 
achieved wealth through their own labors, and by their honorable, straightfor- 
ward dealing commanded the esteem and confidence of those with whom 
they have been thrown in contact. Success and prominence in almost any 
calHng lie along the line of patient, persevering and faithful work. This Mr. 
Jones realized, and resolved that if earnest labor could secure success it 
should be his. His career has therefore been characterized by this factor of 
prosperity, and supplementing this were his keen perception, sound judg- 
ment and natural abilities. There are no other qualities absolutely essential 
to advancement, and upon the ladder of his own building has he climbed to 
eminence and affluence in commercial circles. 

Owen L. Jones was born at Bricksboro, near Port Elizabeth, in Cum- 
berland countv. New Jersey, his parents being Owen and Elizabeth (Lore) 
Jones. His paternal grandfather, Jonathan Jones, removed from Burling- 
ton county, this state.\o Port Elizabeth, where he carried on agricultural 
pursuits throughout the remainder of his life. He was a member of the 



58 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Hicksite division of the Society of Friends, belonging to the ]\Iaurice River 
monthly meeting, and occasionally preached for the denomination. He 
married Miss Mary Owen, and to them were born four children. A daugh- 
ter, Sarah, became the wife of Isaac Baner, and they removed to Ohio, 
wdiere both died. The grandfather of our subject died when about eighty- 
two years of age, and his wife passed away at the age of ninety. A native of 
Burlington county, New Jersey, Owen Jones, the father of our subject, was 
reared to the occupation of farming, and followed that pursuit in connection 
with the butchering business, in Bricksboro, where he spent the greater part 
of his life. In 1855, however, he removed to Salem and retired from business 
there, living in the enjoyment of the fruits of his former toil until called 
to his final rest in 1869. In politics he was first a \Vhig, and on the dis- 
solution of that party he joined the ranks of the new Republican party, with 
which he ever afterward affiliated. He held various township ofifices, includ- 
ing that of freeholder, and was quite prominent in local affairs. In religious 
belief he was connected with the Society of Friends. The three children 
of the family are: Sarah, the wife of Clement Acton, a lumber and hardware 
merchant of Salem; Owen L. ; and Elizabeth, wife of Thomas B. Wood, 
who formerly engaged in dealing in lime and grain in Cumberland county. 
New Jersey, but is now deceased. 

Owen L. Jones, whose name initiates this review, was educated in private 
schools and in the academy at Port Elizabeth, then one of the leading 
educational institutions of that day. He also spent one term in a private school 
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He continued with his father until 1843, 
when he came to Salem and entered upon an independent business career. 
He entered the employ of the firm of Acton & Cattell, dealers in lumber and 
hardware, and thus familiarized himself with business plans and methods, gain- 
ing a practical knowledge of commercial procedure. For six years he re- 
mained with that firm and then joined Clement Acton in the continuance of 
the lumber business, under the firm name of Acton & Jones. That relationship 
continued for two years, when Mr. Acton withdrew on account of ill health 
and was succeeded by Richard Woodnut, under the firm name of Jones & 
Woodnut. For fifteen years they carried on a large and profitable business, 
at the expiration of which time Mr. Jones became connected with the 
extensive enterprise which now claims his attention. He formed a part- 
nership with James K. Patterson, under the firm name of Patterson & 
Jones, for the purpose of engaging in the canning business in Salem, at 
that time located on Church street. In 1881 the senior partner sold his 
interest to James Ayers, and the firm of Jones & Ayers has since carried on 
the business up to the present time. Their factory was erected in 1876 at 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 59 

their present site, for the purpose of securing convenience and better shippnig 
faciHties. and is now one of the largest in the state, furnishing employment 
to two hundred and fifty persons. The plant covers an acre of ground, 
an improvement has been added to the rear of the buildings, and the latest 
and best improved machinery and apparatus have been put in, so that then- 
facilities for carrying on the business in the most approved way are very 
complete. They can tomatoes, and their brand is widely celebrated for its 
superiority. Tliey manufacture their own cans, and in that department of 
the works employ a large force of men throughout the year. Their ship- 
ping department is situated upon their own private wharf on the Salem 
creek. Throughout Mr. Jones' connection with the business it has con- 
stantly increased, both in volume and in importance, until at the present 
time they are turning out a million cans a year, and its goods are now 
shipped throughout a wide territory. They also connnand the best market 
prices and the house sustains a most enviable reputation for reliabilty in 
all trade transactions. Mr. Jones is also the owner of a fine farm of one 
hundred and thirty-five acres on Lower Penn's Neck. 

While prominent in business circles, he has gained equal prominence in 
political life, and has been an important factor in the public life of Salem. 
In his political views he is a stanch Republican, well informed on the issues 
of the day and unswerving in his allegiance to the measures of the party. 
For sixteen years he has been a member of the city council of Salem, and in 
that capacity has labored earnestly and effectively for the progress and 
improvement of the city. The cause of education found in him a valued friend 
during his six years" service on the school board, and he was a member of the 
most important legislature that ever convened in New Jersey,— the assembly 
of 1861,— which passed all the war measures of the state during that period. 
He was also subsequently elected the sheriff of Salem county, serving in 
the years 1862, 1863 and 1864. His official record is without a blot, having 
ever been characterized by loyal and progressive service in behalf of the 
general good. He belongs to that class of representative American citizens 
who while advancing individual prosperity conserve also the public good, 
and his own name is deeply and honorably engraved on the commercial 
historv of Salem. 



H. L. SABSOVICH. 

Among the institutions which have contributed to the substantial de- 
velopment and material progress of southern New Jersey none is more 
worthy of complimentary and favorable mention than the Baron de Hirsch 



6o BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Agricultural antl Industrial School, of which Professor Sabsovich is the 
superintendent. The time has long since passed when education was thought 
to be merely a preparation necessary for the so-called learned professions. 
As a class the farmers are equal in intelligence to almost any other class of 
business men, W'hile the advancement they are making in this direction is 
most remarkable. No longer does the agriculturist put his seed in the 
ground and content himself with waiting till the time of harvest; he can tell 
you the qualities necessary in the soil to produce certain crops: and the 
knowledge how to obtain the needed qualities is becoming widely dissem- 
inated. He can tell you what is demanded in order to secure good returns 
from the garden, the orchard and the dairy, and he knows how to care for 
field, meadow, fruit and stock. The work which Professor Sabsovich is 
conducting in connection with the Agricultural and Industrial School, at 
Woodbine, is a most humane one. He is instructing young men of Jewish 
birth and parentage to become practical, progressive farmers, to understand 
the scientific principles underlying their work and at the same time how to 
conduct their labors so as to bring the merited financial reward. Who can 
measure the influence of such a work? Its effect is incalculable by an} 
known standard, but all recognize its benefit. 

Professor Sabsovich was born February 25, i860, in Berdiansk, in the 
Crimea, and was educated in the University of Odessa and in the Zurich 
Polytechnic College, being graduated in the latter institution with the class 
of 1885. He subsequently established a chemical laboratory in the Univer- 
sity of Odessa, and was assistant agricultural chemist in that institution. 
Subsequently he became the superintendent of a large farm in the northern 
part of the Caucasus, where he proved the practicability of his scientific 
theories and knowledge, continuing in charge there until 1888. when he 
crossed the Atlantic to New York city. There he spent a short time, giving 
private instruction in chemistry-, after which he accepted the position of 
chemist in the experimental station of the Colorado State College, where 
he remained for two years. 

In 1891 Professor Sabsovich was elected the superintendent of the \\'oo(l- 
bine Land and Improvement Company, at Woodbine, New Jersey, and in 
1893 was elected a director of the Baron de Hirsch Agricultural and Indus- 
trial School, which dual position he has since acceptably and capably filled. 
Few men throughout the entire countrv' are better informed on the subjects 
which he makes his specialty or have done as much to promote agricultural 
interests. He is the vice president for Cape May county of the State Forest- 
ers' Association, is the secretary of the Cape May County Agricultural So- 
cietv, a member of the American Pomolosfical Societv and the State Aoricul- 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEIV JERSEY. 6i

•^"^ P'rofessor Sabsovich is a very progressive, enterprising man and popular 
with all classes. He is accounted one of the leading citizens of Cape Ma> 
countv. where his strong intellectuality and broad human sympathy have 
prompted him to the execution of a work whose benefits are manifold. His 
s n-ice m connection with the school at Woodbine deserves extended mem 
tion for the success of the institution is undoubtedly due to him. A Jewish 
colonv has been formed at that place, which is now a thriving town of four^ 
teen hundred inhabitants. It was founded by the trustees of the Baron de 
Hirsch fund in 1891, and the inhabitants are employed either m the four 
factories of the town or upon their farms. There is now a clothing facto, 
emploving one hundred and eighty operatives, at an earning capacity of a 
d"r r and twenty-two cents per day, and annually fifty-five thousand do lar 
'dispensed through the medium of the pay-roll. There are two machine 
shoprfurmshing employment to one hundred and twenty men, with an 
e-irnmo- capacity of a dollar and thirty-seven cents a day, paying out annually 
1 n fi.^ thouLnd dohars; there is a basket factory, in which the employes 
e 1 on an average one dollar per day; and a brickyard. There are no. 
he hundred and fifteen children in school. There are two pub ic-school 
• du gs. a kindergarten with forty pupUs, an evening school with twenty- 
pupis. an agricultural school of one hundred pupds; and a religion^ 
school Seventeen instructors are en.ployed in the town and the cause of edu- 
cation is one held in high esteem in this thriving little commumty. The 
ooZ ompnses sixty-Le farm-houses and one hundred and htty town 
houses erected at a cost of from five to fifteen hundred dollars each. The 
Tew sh synagogue was erected at a cost of seven thousand dollars and is 
i rt he'coLrial style of architecture. There are a bnck pub he bath- 
louse a hotel and other good public buildings, and the and owned by the 
ettlement comprises fifty-three hundred acres, of which fifteen hundred acres 
s under cultivation. The farmers engage in the cultivation of fruits, veg- 
tables and cereals, making a specialty of corn fodder, the latter being pressed 
in a silo Tliey also raise large quantities of peas and crimson, clover. The 



62 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

\\ oodbine Improvement Company expends eleven hundred dollars a month 
in salaries to its employes and nine hundred dollars monthly to pupils for 
food and clothing. In the last two years thirty thousand dollars has been 
expended annually for buildings. The tax realized on the land in its unim- 
proved state was seventy-two dollars, and now the sum of eighteen hundred 
dollars is paid, not including the industries, w hich are not taxed. The Wood- 
bine Improvement Company has invested altogether about three hundred 
and fiftA- thousand dollars at \\'oodbine. and. in addition to this, private in- 
vestments have been made in town property to the value of one hundred 
and twenty-five thousand dollars, and in farm property- forty thousand dol- 
lars. In 1897-8 sixt}- houses were built, and these are sold on the installment 
plan at reasonable rates. In the former years fifteen thousand dollars was 
expended for school improvements: in 1898 twenrv-three thousand more; 
and in 1899 twent}"-six thousand dollars additional. An agricultural school 
building is now being erected, at a cost of twenty-three thousand dollars, and 
will accommodate t\vo hundred and fifty pupils, while cottages for the teach- 
ers are being erected, at a cost of thirty -five hundred dollars. Other im- 
provements being made are a laundn," and greenhouses, costing two thousand 
and fifteen hundred dollars respectively. 

HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL. 

The work which is being done in the school under the able direction 
of Professor Sabsovich is most valuable to the community.". In the winter of 
1893 a few of the brightest boys of the neighborhood, the sons of the Wood- 
bine farmers, were engaged in clearing and improAnng the land of the present 
school-farm. Xo. 60. and private lessons in English, arithmetic and other 
general subjects, were given them. For the benefit of these boys and their 
parents, a series of lectures on practical agriculttiral subjects, accompanied 
by stereopticon view s. were given once a week during the winter months. The 
result of these lectures was so encouraging that it was decided to build a 
large bam on the farm, and use the upper floor as a lecture room. During 
the erection of the building in the spring of 1894 it was deemed advisable to 
change it to its present shape. The space for the stables was reser\"ed for a 
woodwork shop, and the remainder of the first floor converted into a tool 
room, office and shed. The upper floor was divided into a storage room and 
a lecture room, each twentA-five by thirty^ feet. Later two greenhouses, a 
root cellar, a bam for six head of cattle and some poultr\- houses were built. 
With the exception of the main building all the others w ere erected with the 
aid of pupils. The improvements on the farm, including the planting of 
trees and of standard crops, were also made by them. From the beginning 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 63 

continual improvement has been made in the course of study and the work 
carried on. The students are instructed in the English language, arithmetic, 
drawing, history, geography, physics, chemistry, botany, bookkeeping and 
correspondence, geometrical drawing, land measuring, zoology and ento- 
mology, meteorolog}-, and anatomy and physiology. All these gave them 
an understanding of the underlying principles of the practical work which 
is done on the farm, and, in addition, instruction is given concerning soils 
and crops, manures and fertilizers, feeds, the selection and care of domestic 
animals, horticulture, floriculture, landscape gardening, market gardening, 
dairj'ing and farm implements and machinery, and the relation of forestry to 
agriculture. All this is accompanied by practical instruction in field, meadow, 
garden and orchard, together with work in the shops, so that a knowledge 
of mechanics, so necessary to the farmer in the care and repair of machinery, 
may be acquired. The girls in the school largely study the same course save 
that some of the instruction pertaining more to man's outdoor work is 
omitted and that pertaining to the work of the household is substituted, in- 
cluding instruction in the chemistry of foods and cookery, hygiene and nurs- 
ing and household economics and household sanitation. Many of the prod- 
ucts and productions of the farm, prepared or raised by the pupils of the 
school, have won prizes at the Cape May county fairs, and no other agency 
has done so much to promote the interests of the farmer in this section of the 
state as the Baron de Hirsch Agricultural and Industrial School. Its super- 
intendent is a man of broad general as well as scientific knowledge, and 
underlying his intellectual achievements is a genuine and deep-rooted sym- 
pathy for his fellow men and a kindly spirit that prompts him to put forth 
strong efforts to promote the welfare of the race and to introduce such meas- 
ures and improvements as will contribute to their general happiness and 
prosperity. 

WILLIAM J. THOMPSON. 

Perhaps no citizen of New Jersey is more widely known than this gentle- 
man, who in the affairs of life has won a remarkable success and is now 
numbered among the millionaires of his adopted state. His prosperity has 
come to him as the reward of careful management and sound judgment that 
is rarely, if ever, at fault, of unabating energy and honorable business meth- 
ods. He is to-day one of the extensive land-owners of Camden county, and 
is connected with many of the most important business interests of this sec- 
tion of the state. It is said that the man who each night pays over his 
counters hundreds of employes, does more for his country than the com-

mander who leads a regiment forth to battle, for the former furnishes the 
means of life to hundreds of families and promotes the general prosperity and 
welfare of the community in which his enterprises are centered. 

Ireland has furnished to America many of her very successful men, and 
W. J. Thompson is one of the native sons of the Emerald Isle, his birth hav- 
ing occurred in county Derr>% October 15, 1848. His father was Patrick 
Thompson, also a native of county Derry, where fourteen generations of the 
family were born in the same house. The grandfather, Dominick Thompson, 
was a prominent citizen of that community and a well-known contractor. He 
took part in the Irish rebellion of 1798, and on account of his activity in 
the hostilities was forced to flee to the United States, where he became one 
of the contractors who constructed the Market street bridge in Philadelphia. 
His brothers William and John served in the colonial army in the war of 
American independence. For many generations the family owned a large 
tract of land, which was purchased of Captain Murry, one of Cromwell's offi- 
cers, who had received it from the great commoner. Patrick Thompson, 
the father of our subject, was also a prominent man in his day and generation 
and for some time served as a tax collector in the town in which he lived. 
He died in 1887, and his wife, who bore the maiden name of Bridget Mallon, 
passed away in 1892. 

W. J. Thompson, of this review, was only thirteen years of age at the 
time of his emigration to America. He landed in New York and thence 
proceeded to Boston, where he was employed in a store for a short time. He 
then entered a soda-bottling establishment, and before leaving that place a 
few months later, he was given charge of the works. After a year spent in 
New York he came to Philadelphia and had charge of the billiard tables in 
the Continental Hotel, and later was made the manager of the billiard room. 
In 1867 he entered the employ of Captain Frank T. Osborne, a well known 
restaurant proprietor, who soon placed him in charge of the business, where 
he remained for two years. He next became a bar-keeper in the American 
House, and in 1869 opened a hotel on Chestnut street, which became fam.ous 
as "The Hole in the Day" and was a great resort for politicians. 

In February, 1870, Mr. Tliompson married Miss Sarah E. Sweeny, and 
on the 17th of March of that year, leased the Buena Vista Hotel in Glouces- 
ter, Camden county. New Jersey. In 1872 he built the Thompson House of 
the same place and about this time leased the shad-tishing grounds in the 
Delaware river. A little later he purchased these, together with the whole 
front of the Delaware river from the Gloucester Ferry south to a point 
beyond Washington Park, — a valuable fishing water front of three and a 
half miles. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 65 

In 1888 he purchased the Gloucester Ferry and built the Camden, Glou- 
cester & Woodbury Street Railway. For many years one of his principal 
interests has been the development of Washington Park, a beautiful resort, 
in many ways unparalleled throughout the entire countr}'. He first visited 
the place in 1866, and recognizing its possibilities determined that some day 
he would buy it and transform it into the park which now furnishes enjoy- 
ment to so many thousands of people annually. He has here five hundred 
acres of land, and the place is supplied with merry-go-rounds, chutes and all 
kinds of amusements which contribute to the pleasure of both old and young. 
One of the most noted bands of the country. Libretti's New York Band, of 
one hundred pieces, has been engaged for the past four years to give after- 
noon and evening concerts in the park, at the rate of two thousand dollars 
a week. An electric fountain was constructed, at a cost of seventy-five thou- 
sand dollars. Fire-works add to the attractiveness of the place, and nothing 
for the comfort and convenience of the patrons is lacking. Tliis park is un- 
equaled by any other park in the entire countrv-. It is celebrated for the good 
order always maintained there, and for this reason is patronized by the best 
class of people. On the Fourth of July, 1899, there were one hundred and 
twenty-five thousand people upon the grounds! The park is a favorite resort 
with the Philadelphia people, being easily reached by electric cars and by 
steamboats. It is beautifully located on the Delaware river, just across the 
Gloucester county line, and several fine steamers carry passengers to and 
from the city. Even,' summer Mr. Thompson sets aside two days for the 
entertainment of the poor at the park. One day he entertains the poor chil- 
dren of Philadelphia, another of Camden and Gloucester, while each of the 
charitable homes of Philadelphia have a day set apart for their special use. 
On these days the steamers and trolley cars bring the visitor to the grounds 
free of charge, and no charge is made for any of the amusements, everything 
being free for the use of thousands to whom fate has not vouchsafed great 
happiness. He has had sixty thousand poor children from Philadelphia here 
in a single day. The improvements made on the park have cost altogether 
one million dollars. He uses as a hotel the old colonial mansion of General 
Howell, the first governor of New Jersey, and it is still in a perfect state of 
preservation. 

Mr. Thompson also has two hundred and fifty acres of land in the South 
Jersey Jockey Club Race Track, which he reclaimed from the river Delaware. 
He conducted races there, ven,^ successfully, for many years. He also owns 
a seaside, resort of several hundred acres near Long Branch, on which are 
many beautiful cottages and hotels, the place being called Har\'ey Cedars. 
He is the proprietor of Fort Nassau, near Gloucester, where the first settle- 



66 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

ment of the Delaware river was made in 1662. and his home, located in 
Gloucester, is one of the most beautiful residences in the southern part of the 
state. It is located on the Delaware bank and commands a beautiful view 
of the stream and surrounding country. On his three and a half miles of 
water front he has two shad fisheries, with nets three miles long, which they 
haul four times a day, catching four thousand shad at a haul. People come 
for miles to see this wonderful fishing, which indeed is a marvelous catch. 

With many other enterprises Mr. Thompson is also associated. He is 
largely interested in the lumber business in Alabama, being the president of 
the Mobile Sawmill & Lumber Company, which has the finest plant of the 
kind in the country. He is an extensive stockholder in many mines in the 
west, is the treasurer and the heaviest stockholder in the Camden, Glouces- 
ter & Woodbury Electric Railway, is the treasurer and the principal owner 
of the stock of the Philadelphia & Gloucester Ferry Company, and has been 
the supporter of other business interests which have contributed largely to 
the general welfare. 

In his political affiliations Mr. Thompson is a stalwart Democrat, and 
was the recognized leader of his party in this section of the state for many 
years. He served as a delegate to the national conventions in St. Louis and 
Chicago, when President Cleveland was nominated for the second and third 
times. In 1892 he was elected to the New Jersey legislature, where he served 
for two terms, during which time he was the controlling spirit in the house. 
He deserves great credit for the fact that he was instrumental in inaugurating 
the stone-road movement in Camden county, which resulted in securing 
good roads throughout the southern section of the state. He did this while 
serving as a member of the board of freeholders from the second ward of 
Gloucester, which position he filled for fourteen years. He has also been 
a representative of that ward in the city council for seventeen years. Many 
times he has refused to accept federal offices, preferring to devote his ener- 
gies to his business interests, but was in the New Jersey legislature during 
one of its most memorable sessions. 

By his marriage to Miss Sweeny, Mr. Thompson became the father of 
ten children, five of whom are living, as follows: ^^^ J., a lawyer of Camden; 
Sadie E., John S., Leon A. and Rufus B., all at home. One son, Rich J., 
now deceased, was a very bright boy and greatly assisted his father, lia\'ing 
charge of the finances of the park. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson are very chari- 
table people and are devout menibers of the Catholic church. In the sum- 
mer time they distribute many vegetables among the poor, and in the winter 
many loads of coal sent by them find their way to the homes of the needy 
ones in Camden and Gloucester. Mr. Thompson rightly believes in giving 



COXGRESSIOX.-^L DISTRICT OF NEJV JERSEY. 6j 

work to the poor when they desire it and never refuses to furnish some kind 
of employment to the man who seeks it. He has had as high as one thou- 
sand men in his employ, and throughout the past ten years has always had 
at least six hundred men in his employ. He is veiw kind-hearted, yet when 
necessity demands it can be very stern in his dealings with others. He never 
in any way discourages or ill-treats the man who is down, believing it to be 
the duty of people to raise the fallen rather than to force them to remain in 
the depths which they have reached. He contributes most liberally to chari- 
table and benevolent associations, yet his giving is not ostentatious, and 
much of it is never known to the public. His success has been truly remark- 
able, but is largely due to his honesty in all business transactions. Though 
he started out in life as a poor boy, he is to-day a millionaire, and being a man 
of broad humanitarian principles many thousands have benefited by his pros- 
perity. 

THOMAS J. CRAVEN. 

In the picturesque old country of Yorkshire. England, the Craven family 
has been established for many generations, and its representatives have figured 
not inconspicuously in the history of the British empire, holding prestige on 
the score of sterling worth of character and marked intellectuality. From 
the Cravens of Yorkshire the immediate subject of this review is descended, 
and while he may well feel a distinctixe pride in his English lineage, yet even 
greater may be the satisfaction with which he reverts to the ancestral iden- 
tification with annals of the American republic, for the original American 
representative of the name took up his abode here in the early colonial days, 
and through successive generations the name has granted honor to and 
received honor from this nation. 

Thomas Craven, the emigrant ancestor, came to the New World from 
London, England, in 1730. He was a man of fine intellectual gifts, having 
received his education in Oxford College. He was by profession a tutor 
after coming to America and was employed in that capacity in the College 
of New Jersey, at Princeton, attaining a position of distinction in connection 
with educational work. He died in .Vmwell, Hunterdon county. New Jer- 
sey', after a long and useful life. Thomas Craven married Elizabeth Walling. 
of Monmouth county. New Jersey, and they became the parents of eight 
children, of whom we make brief record as follows: Anna, who was born 
in 1737, died unmarried, at Ringoes. New Jersey, at an advanced age; 
Thomas, born in 1739; John, who was born July 3, 1741, was the great- 
grandfather of the subject of this .sketch: ^Miriam, was liorn in 1743 and 



68 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

died in 1785; Gershom. who was born in 1745 or 1746. married Rebecca 
Quick. He was a physician bj' profession and won distinction as a 
surgeon in Washington's army during the war of the Revohition. It is 
worthy of note that certain of Gershom Craven's descendants have won dis- 
tinction in connection with mihtary and naval affairs, the Cravens in the 
navy of the United States at the present time being representatives of the 
line, while others have become prominent as engineers. Dr. Gershom Cra- 
ven resided for many years at Ringoes, Xew Jersey, where he was a prom- 
inent member of St. Andrew's Protestant Episcopal church. Samuel Craven, 
the sixth child in the family of Thomas and Elizabeth (\\'alling) Craven, was 
born in 1749 and died in infancy. William, born in 1751, became a purser in 
the United States navy. Joseph, born in 1754, was accidentally killed while a 
student at Princeton College. 

John Craven, the great-grandfather of him whose name initiates this 
article, was an official in the navy department of the government durmg 
Madison's administration and man\' years afterward. His death occurred 
in the capital city of the nation, where his remains were interred in the 
Congressional cemetery. He married Ann Stewart, a daughter of Dr. David 
Stewart, of Port Penn, Delaware, and they became the parents of one son 
and three daughters, namel}': Thomas, Mar\', Isabella and Eliza R. After 
the death of his first wife ^Ir. Craven consummated a second union, being 
united to Ann Richardson, who bore him one son, Elijah R.. who was a 
physician at the city of Washington, but who died early, leaving a son of 
the same name, who is a prominent Presbyterian clergj'man. He had 
charge of a church for forty years at Newark, New Jersey, but is now on the 
presbytery board at Philadelphia. John Craven died November 5, 1829. 
Thomas Craven, grandfather of Thomas J., was a prominent and influential 
farmer of Newcastle county, Delaware. He married Nancy Aspril, and they 
became the parents of the following named children: Thomas, A\"illiam, 
David S., Ann, Jefferson, Lydia, Jones, John, Mar}- and Joseph. The 
father was born in 1761, and his death occurred in 1814; his wife, who 
was born in 1775, died in 1851. 

David Stewart Craven, the father of our subject, was born at Port Penn, 
Delaware, on the 28th of July, 1802, and his death occurred February 17, 
1862. On the first of March, 1831, he married Rebecca Jane Vandegrift, of 
Dutch extraction, and they became the parents of three children, namely: 
Mary, who was born in 1831, died in 1878, unmarried; John E., born in 1834, 
died in the same year; and John V., who was born January 18, 1840, is 
associated in business with Thomas J., our subject. 

Thomas Jenkins Craven was born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the

he received his preliminary education, after which he completed a course of 
stud a; Delaware College, at Newark, Delaware, graduatu.g at that n.st. 
tution in 1858. On leaving college he became promment y identified with 
agricultural interests m Newcastle countv. but came to Salem, New Jersey, 
in 1880 and in this place has become recognized as a representative citizen 
and business man. being identified with one of the most important mdiistm 
enterprises of the thriving and beautiful little city. There ,s no ndu.ti > or 
which Salem is more justly and widely celebrated than that of t ---'ni*^- 
ure of glass. The greatest progress has marked the history o the leading 
concerns engaged in the business, and their works, in extent and equipment, 
rival anv found in New Jersey. . 

The'Salem Glass Works, of which Mr. Craven is at presen the presided 
of the operating company, were founded in 186. by Hall. Pancoas & 
Craven, who were succeeded in 1879 by John Y. Craven. The expansion of 
the enterprise led to the incorporation of the present company in 1895. _ ihe 
subject of this review became identified with the business in 1881 associating 
hn.self with his brother, John V. Craven, under the firm title of Craven 
Brothers, which obtained until the incorporation of the present stock com- 
panv stvled the Salem Glass Works. The officers of the company are as 
follows:' Thomas J. Craven, president; D. Barton Bullock, treasurer: Lotus 
Pancoast. secretarv: while the directorate comprises John \ . Craven, U. 
Stewart Craven. Thomas J. Craven, D. Barton Bullock and Louis Pancoas . 
The companv have two large plants, one on Third and one on Fourth street, 
covering an area of nearlv eight acres. The five large factory buildings are 
thoroughlv equipi.ed with the latest improved machinery and appliances for 
the rapid 'and economical production of hollow glass-ware. The works 
combined have a capacity for turning out about five hundred gross of various- 
sized bottles each day. and an average force of four hundred skilled opera- 
tives is regularly emplovecl. The output of the great factory is of superior 
qualitv, and the products fin.l a ready demand in all sections of the L mou. 
Fronthig on Fourth street, the company have a general store, which is 
stocked with a complete assortment of dr>' goods, groceries, provisions, fur- 
nishing goods, boots and shoes and miscellaneous merchandise, and here 
the employees of the concern, as well as the general public, are able to secure 
reliable goods at most reasonable prices, this adjunct of the business being 
one which is dulv appreciated by the many workmen employed m the fac- 
tories of the companv. The enterprise is one which has marked influence 
on the progress and material prosperity of the city, and Salem's position as a

manufacturing center has been greatl\' ailvanced l)y the operations of the 
Salem Glass Works. 

In the year 1862 Mr. Craven was united in marriage to Esther C. How, 
the daughter of Rev. James C. How, for t\\ enty-five years the pastor of the 
Presbyterian church of St. George's, Delaware, and they became the parents 
of seven children: Henry, who was born in 1863, died in 1888; John, born 
in 1865. died in 1866; Samuel H., born in 1867, died within the succeeding 
year; Letitia H. was born in 1871 ; Da\i(l Stewart was born in 1873: Mary B. 
was born in 1875; and Jane V. was born in 1877. The death of Mrs. Craven 
occurred in the year 1879, and on the 27th of September, 1882, Mr. Craven 
was united in marriage to ]\Irs. Isabel James, nee Ford, a daughter of David 
Ford, a prominent manufacturer of Philadelphia, where his death occurred 
in 1858, at the age of forty years. He was a representative of one of the 
old families of Newcastle county, Delaware, where he was born. He mar- 
ried Miss Lydia Donnally, and the\- had three children; Alliert M.. who 
resides in Salem, New Jersey- : Irene, who died at the age of seven }ears; and 
Isabel (Mrs. Craven), who was born in Philadelphia, September 13, 1847. 
Mrs. Craven wus educated at Wilmington, Delaware, and is widely known 
as a woman of many accomplishments and gracious dignity. She holds a 
position of distinct prominence in social circles of various orders, and her 
talent and gentle refinement have given her a marked popularity. She is a 
member of the Society of Colonial Dames, and is the president of the New Jer- 
sey branch of this organization. I\Irs. Craven is also the president of the board 
of lady visitors of the Training School for Feeble- Minded Children at Vine- 
land, this state, an institution in which she takes much interest, together 
w^th other philanthropic and charitable work. She has taken a very lively 
interest in the work of the society, and has been a leader in other organiza- 
tions. She was formerly vice president of the State Federation of Women's 
Qubs of New Jersey, and was one of the founders of the Woman's Clul) of 
Salem, of which she formerly served as president. Mrs. Craven also repre- 
sents the first congressional district of New Jersey in the George A\'ashing- 
ton Memorial Association, whose principal object is to secure the establish- 
ment of a memorial university at the national capital. 

In his political adherency Mr. Craven is arrayed in support of the Demo- 
cratic party and its principles, but is not an actne partisan worker. He is 
an ardent sportsman and takes great pleasure in the attractions afield and 
afloat, with gun and rod. He is a member of the society, Sons of Colonial 
Wars, also of the Salem Country Club; and his popularity in social circles is 
equal to that which is accorded in connection with business affairs. He is 
public-spirited in his disposition, and has an abiding interest in all that con- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 71 

serves the progress and prosperity of the city of Salem. His residence is one 
of the most attractive in this city of beautiful homes, and here a gracious hos- 
pitality is dispensed to a representative circle of friends. 



THOMAS B. TURNER, A. M., M. D. 

The stibject of this sketch is one of the leading citizens of Swedesboro, 
New Jersey, and owns and occupies one of the handsomest residences in 
the southern part of the state. He was born on a farm in Woolwich town- 
ship, Gloucester county, New Jersey, February 8, 1848, and is a son of Isaac 
H. and Keziah (Black) Turner. The history of the Turner family in America 
dates back to a period previous to the Revolutionary war, when three broth- 
ers, John, Michael and Restore Turner, came from England and located in 
New Jersey. Michael subsequently entered the English army and was never 
afterward heard from. John settled where Turnersville, New Jersey, is now 
located, and Restore established his home about midway between Swedes- 
boro and Auburn, New Jersey. Restore Turner became the father of the 
following named children: Restore, who lived to the age of seventy years 
and died in Swedesboro; John, who died at the same place, at the age of 
fifty-six years; Samuel, who died at the age of seventy years, in Indiana, 
where he had a family and owned a large tract of land; Isaac H., who died in 
1889, at the age of seventy-eight years, on the old homestead; Gideon, who 
died at the age of sixty-nine years, near the old homestead; Jonathan, who 
died at the age of twenty-two years; Martha, who married John Avis, of 
Woolwich township, Gloucester county; Rebecca, who married Moses Ale, 
of Salem, New Jersey; Sarah, who married George Shoemaker, of Woolwich 
township, and Rachel, who died in early life. Isaac H. Turner had three 
children: Rachel, who died at the age of eleven years; Thomas B., whose 
name introduces this sketch, and Virginia, ^he wife of Charles Fritz, of Phila- 
delphia, Pennsylvania. 

Dr. Turner received his early education in Union School, Logan town- 
ship, and prepared for college in Fort Edward on the Hudson. He entered 
Princeton College in 1869 and four years later was graduated thirty-fifth in 
a class of eighty-seven. He then matriculated at the University of Pennsyl- 
vania, where he pursued a medical course, and graduated March 12, 1875. 
Immediately after his graduation he entered upon his professional career in 
Mount Holly, New Jersey, where he remained six months, removing thence 
to Harrisonville, where he practiced two and a half years. Circumstances 
at this time seemed to favor a return to the homestead farm, which he did. 



7J BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

and until 1889 he was here engaged in seed-growing. He stih owns the 
homestead and an adjoining farm, on which he does a general truck-farming 
business. He removed to Swedesboro in 1889, and has since resided at his 
present location. His home is a large, three-story frame residence, fitted 
and furnished with all the modern luxuries, and surrounded by a beautiful 
lawn comprising eleven and a half acres, the whole making one of the finest 
residences in southern New Jersey. 

Dr. Turner was married April 22, 1875, to Miss Sarah S. Plummer, a 
daughter of James L. and Elizabeth (Witham) Plummer, of Swedesboro. 
Tliey have four children, as follows: Elizabeth P., who is the wife of Edgar 
Hurff, a farmer of Swedesboro; Cordelia P., the wife of Wilbert Ashcraft, 
and with their daughter, Cordelia E., they reside on one of the Doctor's 
farms; and Plummer L. J. and Pressie Tommazetta, who are at home. 

The Doctor and his family attend worship at the Methodist Episcopal 
church. He is a member and examining surgeon of the local A. O. U. W., 
and is also the examining surgeon of the Heptasophs. His political views are 
those of the Republican party. In all matters of public issue he takes a com- 
mendable interest, and especially has he shown an interest in educational 
affairs. He has been a member of the board of trustees of Woolwich town- 
ship and has served as clerk of the board. 



EDWARD L. ALLEN, D. D. 

One of the most eminent divines in the Methodist Episcopal church, a 
celebrated lecturer and a hero of the civil war, is Edward Livingston Allen, 
who has been the pastor at Centerton for the past three years. He is a rep- 
resentative of two of the most prominent families of the state, the Aliens 
and the Livingstons. He was born in Paterson, New Jersey, July 16, 1846, 
and his father, Henry R. Allen, was a native of Blauveltville, New York, and 
was a son of Robert Allen, whose birth occurred in England and who came 
to the United States about the year 1800. The paternal great-grandfather 
w^as a member of the house of commons in the mother country. Robert Allen 
manifested his loyalty to his adopted land by serving in the navy in the war 
of 1812. He afterward married Polly Sears, a daughter of the owner of the 
farm upon which Andre, the English spy of the Revolution, was hung, this 
property being located at Tappan, New York. 

Henry R. Allen was a distinguished inventor and expert draftsman and 
his work won him a reputation which extended over a wide section of the 
country. He made the, draft for the Harlem bridge at New York for the 
New York Central Railroad Company, and also drew the plans of many other

danger. He was always loyally found at his post and made for himself a mili- 
tarv^'record of which he may truly be proud. . , . , 

At the close of the war Dr. Allen returned to New York city and com- 
pleted his preparation for the ministry, since which time he has P-ached he 
gospel in different churches in New York, New Jersey and Colorado. He is 



74 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

an earnest and fluent speaker, his discourses being at once instructive and 
entertaining, appealing both to the hearts and the heads of his auditors. His 
influence for good has been most marked and he is recognized as one of the 
leading ministers of his denomination in New Jersey. On account of his 
scholarly attainments and literary merit the degree of Master of Arts was 
conferred upon him by Taylor University, and that of Doctor of Divinity by 
Franklin College. He has carried his labors into many fields connected with 
human reform, progress and improvement. The cause of temperance has 
found in him a zealous advocate and he has served as Grand Worthy Chief 
Templar of the Independent Order of Good Templars. That ancient and 
benevolent fraternit}-, the Masonic order, numbers him among its valued 
followers, and for two terms he served as Right Worthy Grand Chaplain. He 
was also the chaplain of the New York State Department of the Grand Army 
of the Republic in 1885, and in i885 and 1887 was chaplain of the New York 
state senate. 

The Doctor is a man of very broad culture, has studied both law and 
medicine, and in literary circles has gained distinction as the author of a popu- 
lar work on the civil war. He is also a favorite on the lecture platform and 
in various sections of the country has addressed large audiences on the sub- 
jects: "Both Sides of Army Life;" "The Grave and the Gay," and "How We 
Fought, Foraged and Frolicked on Sherman's Campaigns." He is an elo- 
quent speaker, possessing marked oratorical ability, and the pathos and hu- 
mor of his lectures often move to tears and laughter. He wields a facile pen 
and is master of the art of rhetoric, while 'neath the flowers of speech is a 
substratum of thought and feeling that never fails to command the attention 
and commendation of his hearers. 

The home life of Dr. Allen has been very happy. He was married on 
the nth of August, 1866, to Maggie E. Post, a daughter of Richard Post, 
and their union has been blest with four children: T. May, wife of H. C. Till- 
son, of Highland, New York; Edward G., of West Elizabeth, Pennsylvania; 
Livingston C, who is a student in Pennington Seminany-, New Jersey, and 
Grace, at home. 

At this point it would be almost redundant to enter into any series of 
statements as showing our subject to be a man of broad intelligence and 
genuine public spirit, for those have been shadowed forth between the lines 
of this review. Strong in his individuality, he never lacks the courage of his 
convictions, but there are. as dominating elements in this individuality, a 
lively human sympathy and an abiding charity, which, as taken in connection 
with the sterling integrity and honor of his character, have naturally gained 
to Dr. Allen the respect and confidence of men.

JUDGE C. H. SINXICKSON. 

An enumeration of those men of the present generation who have won 
honor and pul)Hc recognition for themselves, and at the same time have hon- 
ored the state to which they belong, would be incomplete were there failure 
to make prominent reference to the one whose name initiates this paragraph. 
He holds distinct precedence as an eminent lawyer and statesman, and as a 
judge has won the commendation of the legal profession and the discnm- 

inating public. 

A resident of Salem, Judge Clement Hall Sinnickson is also a native ot 
that city, his birth having occurred there September 16. 1834. His parents 
were John and Rebecca (Hall) Sinnickson. and the ancestry of the family 
can be traced Ijack through many generations. In colonial days the family 
was founded in America, and when the original settlement was made a tract 
of two thousand acres of land was purchased from the Indians. ^lost ot 
this is still in the possession of representatives of the name, and the old 
homestead, which was built in 1638, is still owned by the family. When the 
yoke of British oppression l^ecame too heavy to be longer borne, the Swed- 
ish and German people were among the first to declare loyalty to the repub- 
lic, and the Sinnicksons were of the number. Andrew Sinnickson, the 
great-great-grandfather of our subject, was a member of the first council of 
the province of New Jersey, and was a member of both provincial con- 
gresses, held in 1775 and 1776. serx'ing in that capacity at the time New 
Jersev was declared a state. He was a prominent and influential citizen, 
served as a meml^er of the first state legislature from the southern district, 
and was one of the nine men who pledged themselves to furnish money to 
settle the military troubles in New Jersey at the time of the Revolutionar>- 
war. A man of considerable wealth, he contributed generously in response 
to the calls that were made for money needed in prosecuting the war and 
in establishing a permanent form of government in the state. He had 
three sons and two sons-in-law who participated in the struggle for inde- 
pendence and rendered etificient aid to the colonists. When the representa- 
tives of the British government offered to sign a peace treaty in southern 
New Jersey, almost every one in that section of the state was included within 
the amnesty proclamation, but among the few excluded were the Sinnick- 
sons, on account of the actixe part which the>- had taken in provoking re- 
sistance to the British oppressions. Thomas Sinnickson, a great uncle of 
our subject, served as the first congressman from his district in New Jersey, 
and throughout the intervening years representatives of the name have been

prominent factors in the public affairs which go to shape the liistory of the 
comnionwealtli. 

Through marriage the family became connected with several other influ- 
ential families of the state. Colonel Andrew Sinnickson, the grandfather of 
the Judge, married IMargaret Johnson, a daughter of Judge Robert and Mar- 
garet (Morgan) Johnson. Her mother was a daughter of and Mary 

(Moulder) Morgan, of Mercy Hook, Pennsylvania. Her father. Judge 
Johnson, was born in 1727, and served as judge and justice of the peace 
from 1 761 to 1780. His father, also named Robert, was born in 1694, and 
married Mrs. Margaret Sayres, widow of Joseph Sayres. He was a son of 
Richard and Mary (Grover) Johnson. The former, born in Guilford, Surry, 
England, in 1649, became a resident of Salem cotmty. New Jersey, in 1675. 
He served as a member of the house of burgesses in 1707 and was judge from 
1710 up to the time of his death in 1719. Colonel Andrew Sinnickson, the 
Judge's grandfather, had two sons, Thomas and John. The latter married 
Rebecca K. Hall, whose ancestry can be traced back to William Hall, who 
came from Dublin, Ireland, to America and took up his residence in Elsin- 
boro township, Salem county. New Jersey. December 22. 1677. In 1709 
he became judge and fiUetl the j^osition up to the time of his death in 171 8. 
During the latter part of his life he was also engaged in merchandising in 
Salem. He married Sarah Clement, of Gloucester county, and they had a 
son, William Hall. Jr., who was born August 22, 1801. and married Eliza- 
beth Smith, a daughter of David Smith, whose father. John Smith, a resident 
of Amblebury, Salem county, was born in Norfolkshire. England, in 1623. 
With his family he sailed in the ship Grififith to the New World, in 1675. He 
w'as a son of John Smith, of Norfolk, England, and was married in 1638 to 
Martha Craftos, a daughter of Christopher Craftos, of Nottingham, England. 
W'illiam Hall, Jr., and Elizabeth Smith had a son, Clement, who was born 
in 1724 and married Margaret ^Morris, a daughter of Joseph Morris, in 1748. 
They had a son, Clement, Jr.. who was born in 1753 and died in 1809. He 
married Rebecca Kay, daughter of Joseph and Ann (Thompson) Kay, of 
Gloucester county. New Jersey, and their daughter, Rebecca K., who was 
born in 1798, was married in 1826 to John Sinnickson, who was born in 1789 
and died in 1862. This w-orthy couple were the parents of our subject. 

Judge Clement Hall Sinnickson has throughout his life resided in the 
county which was the ancestral home of the Sinnicksons, the Johnsons and 
the Halls. Having acquired his preliminan,- education in the public schools 
of Salem, he attended the Polytechnic Institute, of Troy. New York, and in 
1855 was graduated at Union College, with the degrees of Bachelor of Arts

and Civil Engineer. On the completion of his literary course he began the 
stttdv of law, with Andrew Sinnickson. of Salem, for his preceptor, and was 
afterward a student in the office of Wilham L. Dayton, of Trenton. In 1858 
he was admitted to the bar as an attorney, and in 1864 as a counselor. He 
located in practice m Salem, and soon gained a large and distmctively repre- 
sentative clientage. His arguments were logical, forceful and convmcmg, his 
preparation of cases exact.and his knowledge of the lawis comprehensive and 
accurate These qualities insure success to the practitioner at the bar and 
soon won for Mr. Sinnickson a leading position among his professional 
brethren In 1896 he was appointed by Governor Griggs to the position ot 
iud-e of the common-pleas court of Salem county and has since acceptably 
served in that capacitv. He has also been connected with business interests 
outside of his professional duties and is now a director of the Farmers Mutua 
Fire Insurance Companv. of Salem county, and a member of the Geolog.ca 
Board of New Jersey. He is also the owner of a part of the original tract of 
land purchased by the family. ^r- c 1 

In Tune 1862. Judge Sinnickson was united in marriage to Miss Sarah 
M Smith, a daughter of Lewis P. and Henrietta (Hancock) Smith. They 
had two children, but both died in infancy. The Judge is a member and sec- 
retarv of the vestry of the Episcopal church, and belongs to the Theta De ta 
Psi a college fraternitv. He also holds membership in Johnson Post, No. 
60 G \ R at Salem, being entitled to a place therein by reason of his three 
months' service in the civil war. He was commissioned first lieutenant and 
promoted to the captaincy of Company I of the Fourth Regmient of New 
Tersev Volunteers, and was sent to Fort Runyon, Washington, D. C. where 
he was on picket dutv. He is also the vice president of the Sons of the 
Revolution of New Jersev. In politics he has always been a stanch Republi- 
can and has taken a verv active part in the work of advancing its interests, 
being recognized as one of the party leaders. He represented his district in 
congress for two terms, from 1875 until i879.-two of the most important 
sessions in its historv. He was als9 a member of the Republican state com- 
mittee in 1880. Upon the bench he has discharged his duties with marked 
promptness and abiUty and his decisions have been models of perspicuity and 
justice His logical grasp of facts and principles and the law applicable to 
them has been another element in his success, and a remarkable clearness of 
expression, an adequate and precise diction which enables h.m to make 
others understand not only the salient points of his argument, but also his 
every fine gradation of meaning, may be accounted among his most conspicu- 
ous gifts and accomplishments. 



BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



THOMAS SIXXICKSOX. 

Thomas Sinnickson, Jr.. of Salem. X"e\v Jersey, is one of the most exten- 
sive land-owners and progressive farmers in Salem county, and he is a repre- 
sentative of one of the oldest and wealthiest families of this state. His an- 
cestors came here some two centuries ago and their descendants have been 
prominent in this part of the state ever since, although Thomas Sinnickson 
was born in Philadelphia. The date of his birth is January 21, 1847. His 
parents, Charles and Caroline Elizabeth (Perr}') Sinnichsen (as the name w-as 
then spelled), had removed to that city some time previously, where the 
father was engaged in business for many years. 

In 1550 Sinnich Sinnichsen was ennobled by King Frederick H. of Den- 
mark, and given possession of Hestrip in Angeln, Denmark. In 1600 his 
son, Carlen Sinnichsen, came into the possession of this property through his 
father's death, and it was his son Anders that founded the family in America. 
The frequency with which the name Anders or Andrew is found in both 
the Danish and American branches, together with the similarity of spelling 
and pronunciation of the surname Sinnickson, or Sinnichsen, are strong evi- 
dence that both are from the same origin. Victor J. N. Sinnichsen. of Den- 
mark, believes the name to have had its origin in Germany, during the middle 
ages, and that the family were in possession of noble estates in that country. 
The family coat of arms, still retained by many Danish members of the family, 
consisted of a saddled horse tied to a bush or low tree in a valley. Andrew 
Sennickson, or Senecason, as it is found in Companion Hahn's History of 
Sweden, it is believed, came to America about the year 1627, with the earliest 
Swedish emigrants who landed at Cape Hinlopen (now Henlopen) and 
w'orked their wav up the Delaware river and settled in what is now Lower 
Penn's Neck township, about the year 1645. He purchased a large tract of 
land in that section, which was then called Obisquahassit; and upon the ar- 
rival of John Fenwick in 1675 to take possession of his tenth of west Jersey, 
Sinnick Sinnickson secured from the new proprietor a quit-claim deed to 
the tract in consideration of a yearly stipend of three shillings. Many gen- 
erations of the family have made their home upon this land, a large portion 
of it still being owned by his descendants. Accompanying him to America 
were two sons, — Anders and Broor, or Brewer. The latter located in Dela- 
ware and his descendants are found widely diffused over Delaware and Penn- 
sylvania and spell the name Sinnexson. Andrew, the fourth, was born in 
1 7 18, in Lower Penn's Neck, and was one of the most prominent men of his 
time. He was the judge of the court of common pleas at Salem under

quarters at that time on Ninth street. He was interested in all local affairs. 
He served for several years as director of the old Pennsylvania Bank and 
was public-spirited to a high degree. He married Catherine Elizabeth Perry, 
a daughter of Charles and Sarah (Hufty) Perry, and reared two sons, — 
Charles Perry and Thomas. Charles Perry was born Octoljer i, 1844, and 
was educated in the Episcopal Academy and the University of Pennsylvania. 
Finishing his education he engaged in the coal-shipping business in Phila- 
delphia with his father and found it a most profitable venture. He married 
Miss Emma Rosengartenand is now retired from active business and resides 
in Philadelphia. Their children are Caroline. Elizabeth, Charles, George, 
Clinton, who died in infancy, and Fannie. 

Thomas Sinnickson, Jr., was a student in the Episcopal Academy of Phil- 
adelphia and afterward took private lessons of Major Mordecai, who was 
sent by our government to Europe with General McClellan to study military 
tactics. He studied under Major Mordecai for two years and then accepted 
a clerkship in the firm of Sinnickson & Glover, which he held for two and 
.one-half years. He then entered a partnership with his brother, Charles, 
and Thomas J. Yorke, under the firm name of Sinnickson & Company and 
engaged in shipping coal until 1876, when he retired from the firm. He 
owns considerable property in the vicinity of Salem, the old homestead, in 
Lower Penn's Neck township, which he has made his home since retiring 
from commercial life, and which contains two hundred and forty-five acres, 
while his two farms, immediately adjoining it, contain one hundred and fifty 
acres each. He is also largely interested in other business enterprises, own- 
ing stock in the Salem Opera House, the electric-light plant, and is a director 
in the Salem National Bank. 

He was married October 14, 1875, to Miss Francis Fornian Sinnickson. 
and one child, a daughter. Miss Alice Margaret Sinnickson, has blessed their 
home. The family is one of the most respected and esteemed in the county 
and their hospitality is unbounded. Mr. Sinnickson has lately purchased the 
Thompson property, located on Broadway in Salem, and is putting that 
handsome residence through a process of remodeling that will make it one 
of the most convenient modern residences in the city. When it is completed 
it is his intention to make it his home. He is a Democrat in his political 
views and an attendant at, and liberal contributor to, the Episcopal church. 
He was formerly a member of the Halaska Cadet Corps, a military school of 
Philadelphia, while a resident of that city. He is wide-awake and progres- 
sive and has by travel added largely to an already well stored mind. After 
retiring from the coal business he went abroad, visiting dififerent parts of 
Europe. The parents of Mrs. Sinnickson are J. Howard and Sarah Eliza-

Throckmorton. 



B. ARCHER WADDINGTON. 

One of the leading members of the medical profession in Salem county 
and southern New Jersey is B. A. Waddington, M. D., who comes from one 
of the old county families. He enjoys an immense practice and is considered 
an authority upon a vast number of the diseases to which flesh is heir. 

The Waddingtons are of French-Huguenot origin, and the Doctor's pa- 
ternal grandfather was Robert Waddington, a farmer and respected citizen 
of this county. James T. Waddington, the father of our subject, was one of 
the leading business men of the town of Salem in his day. 

The birth of Dr. Waddington occurred February lo, 1841, in Salem, and 
in the public schools of this place he obtained his elementary education. 
When he had arrived at a suitable age he' commenced the study of medicine," 
under the preceptorship of Dr. Thomas B. Dickinson, and in 1865 was gradu- 
ated in the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania. Since 
that time he has been established in Salem, where he soon built up an exten- 
sive practice and won the good will and high regard of his professional 
brethren. He occupies a finely fitted, modern suite of offices, where all of 
the necessary medical equipments and conveniences are to be found. His 
counsel is frequently sought by physicians and surgeons from far and near, 
and his judgment is considered conclusive, well founded and final. During 
a period of five years he was the attending physician at the Salem county 
almshouse. For many years he has also acted an important part in numerous 
medical organizations. He was the vice-president and then the president of 
the Salem County Medical Society, and was the censor in the organization. 
For years he has been a delegate to the New Jersey State Medical Society and 
has frequently represented that society in the state medical organizations of 
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Delaware. He has for a number of years 
been a permanent delegate to the State Society. For fifteen years he has been 
sent as a delegate to the American Medical Association, and twice has been 
the secretary of the section on diseases of children. In 1893 he was further 
honored by being appointed as a member of the auxiliary committee of the 
Pan-American Medical Congress, and the same year he was appointed the 
censor of the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia. Many of the 
papers which he has presented are regarded as valuable contributions to the 
literature of the medical science.

The Doctor was married October 6, 1869, to Elizabeth W. Acton, a 
daughter of Benjamin Acton. She died February 8, 1872. and March 20, 
1878. Dr. Watkhngton wa.s united in matrimony with Mrs. Hettie C. Davis, 
a daughter of Frankhn and Ehzabeth \V. Miller. One of the marked qualities 
of Dr. Waddington is his kindliness and genuine desire to help others in 
every possible manner. Under his wise superintendence five young men have 
studied medicine in his office, and each one of them is now well established 
in practice. He is identified as a member with the Masons and with the 
Broadway Methodist Episcopal church. In his daily life he carries out the 
noble principles of Masonry and Christianity, and loves to aid and uiilift. 
cheer and insj^ire his fellow men. 



LOUIS PANCOAST. 



Louis Pancoast is a son of Joseph and Alary Jane (Barnes) Pancoast. He 
was born in Salem county about forty years ago. He is descended from an- 
cestry honorable and distinguished who came to New Jersey at an early day, 
and, through hardships and sufferings such as the present generation ha\-e 
little knowledge of. assisted in laying the foundation for the present iiros- 
peritv. progress and advancement of Salem county. The first of the name m 
America was John Pancoast, who emigrated from London, England, taking 
passage on the good ship Mary in 1678. He was at one time sheriff of the 
tenth district of New Jersey, then comprising a territory extending from the 
middle of Main street in Burlington to the Assinipink creek in Trenton and 
across to the Atlantic ocean. He had two sons, — John and Joseph. Joseph 
was married and among his children was a son named Edward, who settled 
near Clarksboro. New Jersey. He and his wife had a son John, who married 
Sarah, a daughter of Bradway and Jane (AA'addington) Keasby, of Hancock's 
Bridge, New Jersey. They settled in that locality and afterward removed to 
Mullica Hill, where they spent their remaining days and were buried in the 
Friends' cemetery there. Among their children were Hannah, .Achsah, John, 
Israel, David C. and Aaron K. 

David C. Pancoast, the grandfather of our subject, resided in Woodstowa 
but followed farming in Pittsgrove township. He was a member of the So- 
ciety of Friends and in political belief was a stanch Republican. He married

26. 1881. in his se\-enty-cighth }-ear. The Davis family is of royal descent. 
the ancestry being traced back in an unl)roken Hne to Edward I, King of 
England. A later representati\e of the family was Sir Thomas W'yatt, of 
Allington Castle, who married Lady Jane Hawte. They had two children, — 
George and Lady Jane Wyatt. The latter became the wife of Charles Scott, 
of Edgerton, Kent, who also was of royal descent. Their son, Thomas Scott, 
of Edgerton, died in 1635. He was twice married, his second union being 
with Jane Knatchljull, whom he married in 1604 and who died in 161 5. She 
was a daughter of John Knatchbull, of Mershom Hatch. Among their chil- 
dren was Dorothea Scott, who came to Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York, 
in 1680, accompanied by the children of her first husband, Major Daniel 
Gotherson, who died in 1666. She was again married, in 1680, becoming 
the wife of John Davis, of Oyster Bay. They removed to Piles Grove town- 
ship. Salem county, in 1705. One of their children was Judge David Davis, 
of Salem county, who married Dorothy Cousins, who was born in if')93 and 
died in 1789. 

David Davis was the second child of Judge David Davis and Dorothy 
(Cousins) Davis. He was born in Salem county, New Jersey, in 1730. and 
married Martha Cole. He had two children. The elder, David Davis. Jr.. re- 
sided in Salem county and married a Miss Haines, by whom he had three 
children: Anna, wife of Allen Fennimore; Martha, wife of Tobias Griscom, of 
Salem, New Jersey, and Joseph, who married a Miss Collins. 

Joseph Davis, the second son of David and Martha (Cole) Davis, resided 
in Salem county and wedded Mary Haines. They had two children, the 
elder being Martha, who became the wife of William Folwell and the mother 
of Joseph D. Folwell. They lived in Philadelphia. The younger, Anna 
Davis, became the wife of David C. Pancoast, of Woodstown, New Jersey, 
the paternal grandfather of Louis Pancoast, whose name heads this sketch. 
Their children were Mary D.. Joseph D., Martha F., Anna. David, William, 
Charles F. and Belle. 

Of this family Joseph D. Pancoast was the father of our subject. He 
was bom in W^oodstown, Salem county, July 9, 1833. and was educated in 
Woodstown and the Fremont Seminary at Morristown. Pennsylvania. He 
married Miss Mary Jane Barnes, of Woodstown, a daughter of Joseph Barnes 
and a lineal descendant of John Sharpless. The maternal ancestry has been 
traced back to the latter part of the seventeenth century and is a record of 
which our subject may well be proud. John Sharpless came from England 
in 1682 with three sons, John, James and Joseph, and settled in the southern 
part of what is the present state of New Jersey. John Sharpless. Jr.. was

tlie father of Ann Sharpless, who was bom in 17 10 and married Samuel Bond, 
of Maryland. Her remains were placed in the graveyard at Shiloh. Two 
of her daughters married two lirothers, Elkanah and Jonathan Davis, of 
Shiloh, this state, the latter of whom was pastor of the Shiloh church and 
died there in 1785, at the age of fifty-two years. His wife, Margaret, lived to 
the extreme age of ninety years and was laid to rest in 1822. One of their 
children, Samuel Davis, was also pastor of the same church as his father for- 
merly had charge of and died in 1834. at the age of se\-enty-fi\-e years. He 
was married four times, his second wife being the daughter of Joshua Ayars, 
and died in 1797. She left an only child, called for her mother. Mary Davis, 
who was born January i, 1795, and died in 1838. Her husband was Lot 
High, a son of Anderson Ouincy High, who was born in 1789 and died in 
1857. They had a large number of children, of whom Phoebe Ann, the eldest, 
was the grandmother of our suljject. She was united in wedlock to Joseph 
Barnes, of Woodstown. who was a son of Joshua and Rebecca (Haines) 
Barnes. Joshua was the son of John Barnes, a proprietary resident of Pitts- 
grove township before W'oodstown received its name. He died August 11, 
1828. at the age of sixty-two years. His wife, Rebecca, was from Burlington 
countv and died in 1826. at the age of seventy vears. Jose]ih Barnes was 
born in 1796 and died in 1853, and his first wife, Phoebe Ann. died in 1849, 
when near her thirty-fifth \ear. They have three children still lix'ing. namely: 
Rebecca, who married Morris Hall and is a resident of Missouri; Araliella, 
who married Daniel Stratton and resides in the same state: and ^lary Jane, 
who married Joseph D. Pancoast and is the mother of Louis Pancoast. 

After the marriage of Joseph D. and Mary Jane (Barnes) Pancoast. they 
took up their residence on the old homestead farm in Pittsgrove township, 
where they remained two years. In 1859 they removed to Salem, where Mr. 
Pancoast engaged in the milling Inisiness. He operated the old white stone 
mill four years and then became identified in the manufacture of glass in the 
firm of Hall, Pancoast & Cra\-en. Pic was a practical glass-maker and con- 
ducted his share in the en.terprise in a highly credital:)le manner, contributing 
in no small degree to the successful operation of the business. He remained 
in this firm until his death, December 7, 1879, and his death was a blow to 
the company, taking from it, as it did, one of their most able and efificient 
of^cers. He was a Republican in his political affiliations and a member of 
the Hicksite Society of Friends. He was also a prominent Mason and dur- 
ing the war was a member of the home-guard militia. His marriage to Mary 
Jane Barnes was solemnized February 26, 1857, and resulted in the birth of 
the following children, namely: Louis, born May 11, 1859; David Archer, 
born Mav 8, 1868, and married Helen, a daughter of Delwin Francis Smith,

is a resident of Philadelphia, where he is engaged in clerking, and Morris 
Hall, born April 2-/. 1877. is employed in the lianking department of the 
Philadelphia Public Ledger. 

Louis Pancoast attended the high school of Salem, but left school at an 
early age to accept a clerkship in his father's glass-works. He has risen from 
that position to the oflfice of secretarj- and director of the company, and 
gives to the business his imdivided attention. The company aftenvard took 
the name of the Salem Glass ^^'orks, and is one of the largest glass plants in 
this i)art of the state and does a large business. He is a member of the board 
of health, the Fenwick Club and the Country Club, and is a prime favorite 
in social circles. Li politics he is a warm sympathizer with Republicanism 
and keeps well up on all problems of the day. 

On the 1 2th of February. 1896. Mr. Pancoast was united in marriage to 
Miss Laura Casper, a lady of charming personality and many accomplish- 
ments. She is a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth (Gillingham) Casper. 

Joseph Casper, son of Tliomas Jefferson Casper and Mary Ann, nee And- 
erson, was born July 20, 1832, in Salem county. His occupation was farming 
until he was about twenty-three years of age. when he removed to Philadel- 
phia with his father and engaged in keeping the Davis Hotel. He married 
Elizabeth Rich Gillingham. of that city. January i. 1862. and died February 
14. 1S79. by a railroad accident at Torresdale. Pennsylvania. His father, 
Thomas Jefferson Casper, was the son of John and Hannah (Wentzell) Cas- 
per, and was bom July 12, 1802. His father. John Casper, was the son of 
Lawrence Casper, born 1775. Lawrence Casper's father, also named Law^ 
rence. emigrated to this countn,- from Germany when a young man. and 
died March 2. 1810. aged ninety years. Hannah Wentzell Casper, grand- 
mother of Joseph Casper, was the daughter of Charles \\'entzell. a Revolu- 
tionary soldier, who died in 1835, aged ninety-two years. 

The ancestry of the Gillingham family can be traced back to Yeamans 
Gillingham. who was the first of the name in this countrv'. He came to 
Anicrica from the south of England about 1682 or 1683 and wedded Mar}^ 
Taylor, who crossed the Atlantic about the same time. They had seven chil- 
dren. Yeamans purchased one hundred acres of land in Oxford township, 
now Frankford, from William Penn in 1696, and afterward sold that 
property to Thomas Bristol, who, on the nth of November, 1786, 
sold it to Henry Paul, and the last named sold it to Yeamans Gillingham, 
the grandson of Yeamans Gillingham. first. The latter transaction occurred 
Ma-.ch 9. 1793. His property included all the land enclosed by the road lead-

ing from the United States arsenal around to the Friends' meeting-house, 
thence northwest to tlie Black Run. thence by nearly a straight line from 
Sacony creek to the river and the arsenal road again. Yeamans Gillingham 
either died there or moved with his son James to the edge of Salisbury town- 
ship, near the Buckingham meeting-house. General Henry Knox offered 
James Gillingham the command of the First Marine Corps. He was ser- 
geant major of the McPherson Blues. The same James Gillingham was in 
the battle which is known in history in connection with the whisky insurrec- 
tion. The children of Yeamans and Mary (Taylor) Gillingham were: Ann, 
who was born May 8, 1694, and married Henry Paul, in honor of whose 
familv Paul street in Frankford is named; Mary, who was born October 21, 
169S. and liecame the wife of James Wilson; Sarah, who was born September 
27, 1699, and married Abraham Spicer; Elizabeth, who was born February 
22. 1705, and married Samuel Eastburn; James, who was born August 2, 
1708, married Martha Canby and died November 4, 1745; Joli". who was 
born May 12, 17 10, and located in Philadelphia, and Susanna, who was born 
November 29, 171 2. The children of James and Martha (Canby) Gilling- 
ham were: John, who had twelve children; Yeamans, who was bom August 
15, 1734. married Ruth Preston December 21, 1763, and after her death 
wedded Bridget Moon, in 1768, and died February 26, 1825; James, who 
lived in Philadelphia, was born July 26, 1738, and married Phoebe Hallowell; 
Joseph, who was born May 14. 1743- married Elizabeth Haney and lived at 
Falsington until his death. May 17, 1794; Thomas, who lived in Philadelphia; 
Martha, who was married to Jonathan Kinsey June 9, 1763, in Bucks county; 
Lavina and Benjamin. The Canby family, of which Mrs. Pancoast is a de- 
scendant, was founded in America by Thomas Canby, who came to this coun- 
try July 17, 1688. He was a justice of the peace from 1719 to 1738 and was 
a member of the legislature from 1731 to 1738. 



GEORGE L. SMITH. 



Rev. George L. Smith is now the pastor of the Presbyterian church at 
Elmer, and through his devotion to his holy calling has exerted a strong in- 
fluence for good throughout the community. He was born at Pound Ridge, 
Westchester county. New York, June 15. 1837, and is of English lineage. 
His father. Samuel D. Smith, was a son of J0I) Smith, and was bora, it is 
confidently believed, in Monticello, New York. His paternal uncles held 
oir.ce under the king before the Revolutionary war, and his maternal grand- 
father was Judge IMiller, of Revolutionary fame. Samuel D. Smith followed 



88 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

the dual occupation of merchandising and school-teaching. He married 
Sallie A. Delavan, who was of French descent, and they became the parents 
of three children: Roswell D., who is a minister and physician, of New York; 
George L., and Elbert M., who is in the employ of the Delaware, Lackawanna 
& Western Railroad in Bergen county, New Jersey. The father of these chil- 
dren died June 29, 1869, but the mother is still living and has attained the 
advanced age of eighty-three years. 

Rev. G. L. Smith acquired his preliminar\' education in the public schools 
and afterward pursued his studies under the direction of Rev. A. L. Linds- 
ley, D. D.. who was later a professor in the Presbyterian Theological Semi- 
nary of San Francisco. He was also a student of Union College, of Schenec- 
tady, New York, is a graduate of the New York University, of the class of 
1862, and was graduated at the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1865, 
being a classmate of Rev. Francis L. Patton, LL. D., S. Stanhope Orris, Ph. 
D., and Professor Raymond, D. D., all of Princeton University, and Rev. E. 
T. Jefifers, D. D., president of the York Collegiate Institute. Mr. Smith was 
licensed to preach by the Second presbytery of New York and was ordained 
by the presbyten,- of Passaic, New Jersey. He served as the pastor of Ruther- 
ford until 1 87 1, when he received a call from the church in Ewing, New Jer- 
sey, where he remained for eight years. He then went to Cedarville. this 
state, and in 1883 removed to York, Pennsyhania. He found but one Pres- 
byterian church there. He organized a new church, the Calvary Presby- 
terian, of which he was given charge on the 17th of October, 1883. There 
was rapid growth, especially in the Sabbath-school, and a number of addi- 
tions were made to the chapel. There was also a new house of worship 
erected, and a manse, altogether making a group of buildings which stands 
as a monument to the devoted labors of Rev. Mr. Smith. During his pas- 
torate the membership was increased from twenty-seven to about three hun- 
dred, and while actively laboring in York, was at the same time instrumental 
in suggesting and instituting a number of auxiliary organizations. On the 
1st of May, 1898, he became pastor of a Presbyterian church in Elmer, where 
he has since done effective work. 

On the 2 1 St of November, 1865, Mr. Smith was united in the holy bonds 
of matrimony with Carrie N. Olden, of Princeton, New Jersey, who died 
August 12, 1871. leaving one son, George E., who is now in the newspaper 
business, being connected with the York Daily, of York, Pennsylvania. On 
the 5th of June, 1879, ^^'"- Smith married Sarah G. Scudder, a daughter of 
Dr. J. W. Scudder, of Ewing, New Jersey. She is to him an able assistant 
in his work and shares with her husband the high regard in which he is uni- 
versally held.

Rev. ^Ir. Smith takes a deep interest in civic and governmental aiTairs, 
and, believing the Republican party best calculated to advance the interests 
of the nation, he gives to it his support. He has been a frequent contributor 
to newspapers and his writings cover a variety of subjects. He has written 
and published two serial stories, and many of his sermons have appeared in 
leading journals. For some years he was a member of the board of trustees 
of the York Collegiate Institute, for a while vice president of the board 
and for some time the secretary of the executive committee. He is a man 
of scholarly attainments, of broad general information, of humanitarian prin- 
ciples and of kindly sympathy. His discourses show deep thought and com- 
prehensive knowledge, and his relations with his fellow men indicate a true 
Icve of the race and a strong desire to uplift humanity to a higher plane of 
living. 



ROBERT GWYNNE. 



Some one has remarked that "the artistic and useful career of the late 
Robert Gwynne was a vindication of the country editor against every charge 
that has ever been laid at his door." This is true only as it calls attention 
to the dignity to which an editor may attain after years of conscientious labor 
in a "country city." All country editors are not men of the ability and ster- 
ling worth of a Robert Gwynne, and Robert Gwynne was more than a coun- 
try editor: he was a thorough journalist, of the best metropolitan training of 
his day, transplanted to the environments of a slow-growing, law-abiding little 
city, who gave the best there was in him, and there was little that was not 
good and healthful and progressive, toward the advancement of all of the best 
interests of a people peculiarly upright and desennng, for the Quaker blood 
that animates Salem and gives color to its social and commercial character is 
a precious heritage. Robert Gwynne's success cannot atone for the sins 
of omission and commission of which the average country editor is guilty, 
but the contemplation of it should have been and doubtless was a means of 
placing very many country editors on a higher plane. All who strive to 
emulate him must remember, too, that Robert Gwynne was in himself more 
to his town than his paper was, good as it was. He had been a living, animat- 
ing force in Salem for half a century, and the good that he did will not die. 

Robert Gwynne was a native of Ireland, born in 1827, and came to this 
countrs' at the age of thirteen years. His ancestors were Welsh, antl the 
family is associated with some of the leading families of Great Britain, the 
Gwynne Company of London and Londonderry having been founded by 
some of his ancestors. "He first set eyes on the little town of Salem," writes 



90 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

J. H. C. Applegate, "in the fall of 1849. During December of the same year 
Mr. Gwynne and Nathan S. Hale, both young men and Philadelphia printers, 
purchased the right, interest and title (there was but little else to buy) in the 
Salem Sunbeam, then owned and published by Israel Wells, Escj. Mr. Wells 
was not a practical printer and the Simbeam was far from being an ideal 
newspaper even for those days of easy-going journalistic ways. \\'ells had 
established the paper here in 1844, since which time it had been going from 
l^ad to worse, sometimes appearing on the street from three to four days after 
the date of its issue and sometimes missing an issue altogether. Such was 
the status of the Sunbeam when purchased by Messrs. Gwynne and Hale, late 
graduates of the ofifice of the Pennsylvanian, of Philadelphia, a paper presided 
over in part by that superb letter writer and journalist, John W. Forne}-. The 
copartnership was of but a short duration, and in a brief time Mr. Gwynne 
was left alone to wield the editorial pen, and, as he sometimes said, 'to shoul- 
der the debts.' The public may gather from this something of the early trials 
of the Sunbeam published in 1849 and judge of its steady growth since. The 
Sunbeam has now been so long before the public that there are subscribers 
all o^•er Salem county who do not remember the time when it was not a 
weekly \-isitor to their homes, and the name of Robert Gwynne a familiar 
household word. It is not my purpose to magnify the work of Mr. Gwynne 
or the character of the worker, but as the Sunbeam has been so inseparably 
a part of its publisher for these many years it is impossible to divorce the one 
from the other. The personality of the editor has shone out in the written 
Sunbeam every week from the year 1849 until now, and there has been no 
mistaking it." 

Mr. Gwynne died at his residence in Salem, March 20, 1899. His last 
appearance in the town was at the polls, at the municipal election of Salem 
six days before. "Mr. Applegate, who was with him on that day, states that 
he did not hear him refer to the election once until about half past three, when 
he entered the ofifice with his overcoat tightly buttoned about him. T am 
going to vote.' he said, and then in liis sententious way continued, 'Get on 
your coat and hat and go with me.' But I interposed, 'Mr. Gwynne, let me 
order a carriage and' — but he stopped me by saying, 'We can walk it all 
right." So arm in arm we walked to the polls (perhaps three-quarters of a 
mile distant), where he deposited his last vote. .\t the polls he was greeted 
in hearty recognition by all present, some, perhaps, reading in the blanched 
face and tottering steps the sad sequence so soon to follow. On leaving the 
polls a friend among the bystanders, noting the enfeebled condition of Mr. 
Gwynne, volunteered his service to help conduct him home, and so, escorted 
between us, tlie sufTering editor wearily took uj) his homeward way. That 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 91 

was the last time he ever paced our streets and the last time I e\-er saw him 
alive." 

Mr. Gwynne was a Democrat of Democrats, and all his life a devoted 
disciple of the Jeffersonian idea of politics; but he was never obtrusiveh^ of- 
fensive in their assertion, and, w hile he rendered valuable service to his party, 
he was not a seeker after public office. He was, however, at one time the city 
treasurer of Salem, and a member of the school board and a justice of the 
peace. He was also a director of the East View cemetery, and for many 
years a prominent member of the Broadway Methodist Episcopal church of 
Salem. For many years after the retirement of Mr. Hale, Mr. Gwynne was 
in full charge of the Sunbeam, until his son, Robert Gwynne, Jr., now the 
mayor of Salem, was made an associate editor. Mr. Gwynne also published 
a paper, the Franklin Herald, at A\'oodstown. in 1852, but this was discon- 
tinued after a few months, Mr. Gwynne held the theory that every man is 
the peer of his fellow if he wants to be. Once a gentleman in conversation 
with him used the phrase "best people" in a sense that implied aristocracy. 
"Don't mention that again," said the blunt oUl editor: "there is no 'best peo- 
ple,' sa\'e as they make themselves such. Fine houses, fine clothes, plenty of 
money and all the accessories make no persons best people; and as a Demo- 
crat from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet I recognize no such dis- 
tinction; the men who impro\e their opj^ortunity are the best people: no 
others are." 

Other incidents of like import might be mentioned; but Mr. Gwynne's 
character is sufficiently indicated l)y the words of one who knew him well 
and long: "His ambition was to publish a great newspaper, and the Sun- 
beam is the best proof of his success in that direction. Although mingling in 
politics all these years, he never stooped to what is known as corrupt politics, 
maintaining even in this an honest}- that was impregnable. He was pure in 
all his habits of life, and the writer, who has been a close associate all these 
years, never knew him to use a profane word or utter a deliberate falsehood: 
he aljhorred both. In all his life he was a model of uprightness and temperate 
habits." 

Mr. Gwynne's wife was Mary J. Camp before marriage. She died in 1865, 
ha\ing borne him four children: Jennie, Robert, Jr., Isabella and Helen. 
One of the sad incidents of his death was the absence of his son, Robert 
Gwynne, Jr., the junior editor of the Sunbeam and mayor of the city of Salem, 
in Cuba. Robert Gwynne, Jr., who has for some years carried the office re- 
sponsibilities of the newspaper enterprise, with many others, on his shoulders, 
was born at Salem, New Jersey, November 27, 1857, and was graduated atthe 
high school of his native city in 1876. November 9, 1887, he married Miss 



92 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Carrie Rulon. a daughter of John C. Rulon. the cashier of the National Bank 
of Swedesboro. Xew Jersey, who has borne him a daughter, named Dorothy. 
Immediately upon leaving school he identified himself with his fathers pub- 
lishing business. In 1885 he became a partner in the enterprise. For the 
past fifteen years, though his father did much regular work on the paper until 
a few days before his death, the son has been the nominal and responsible 
business editor. His influence in the community may be estimated when it is 
stated that he was. for four years, a member of the board of education of the 
city of Salem, was superintendent of the schools of Salem from 1888 to the 
fall of 1893, when he resigned, and was for three successive terms (1888-97) 
the county superintendent of the schools of Salem county, was the Demo- 
cratic nominee for state senator from Salem county and was defeated by only 
ninety-five votes in a total of si:s thousand, in a year when there was no Demo- 
crat elected in the state and when he came nearer election than any other; 
and was elected mayor of Salem in 1897, to fill a vacancy caused by the 
resignation of his predecessor in the office and was re-elected for a full term 
a year later by a majority of two hundred and fifteen out of a total vote of 
one thousand, three hundred and fifty, over two opposing candidates. Mr. 
G\\"Anne made the fight for the mayoralty chiefly on his advocacy of good 
roads. It is his contention that the city of Salem has been backward in 
matters of public improvement, and. with hard, persistent, tireless work, he 
is trying to put it in advance of other enterprising and up-to-date cities. He 
is making headway surely, but slowly and gradually, and believes that a 
majority of his fellow townsmen will endorse ever)" aggressive step he may 
take toward modernizing the town and imparting to it that air of prosperous 
enterprises which characterize nearly all American cities at this time. A 
forceful writer with an influential newspaper at his command, our able 
speaker, who never lacks for an audience when it is known that he has a 
message to deliver to the people, a planner on a broad scale and for substan- 
tial building and a worker who never rests or falters, he is surely making 
headway against the apathy of some of his richer townsmen ; and under his 
guidance Salem has entered upon a period of development which it is confi- 
dently believed will witness many important changes that will be influential 
toward the future prosperity. 

Mr. Gwynne's Democracy is of the same sterling stamp as was his father's. 
He has almost from his youth been active in political work and has been a 
delegate to many state and county conventions of his party and chairman of 
the Democratic county committee and member of important state commit- 
tees, and has always had much to do with shaping party policy and measures. 
He early became a member of the volunteer fire department of Salem. He 



COXGRESSlCn^'AL DISTRICT OF XEIF JERSEY. 93 

is a member of the Pen and Pencil Club, of Philadelphia, and he is a communi- 
cant and has sensed as clerk of the ^Memorial Baptist church, of Salem. He 
is one of the most prominent citizens of Salem county, and the large number 
of men who like his aggressive, progressive ideas and administration believe 
that if he wants to carry his work into future administration he can be re- 
elected mayor of the city of Salem on the strength of what he has accom- 
plished and is accomplishing. 



BEXTAMIX F. LADD. 



Benjamin F. Ladd, the editor and proprietor of the Vineland Evening 
fournal. and also a member of the well-known firm of Ladd & Steele, dealers 
in real estate and insurance, was born May 4, 1855, in Appleton, Wisconsin, 
a son of Harvey Hammond and Lucinda B. (Perry) Ladd. The preceding 
generations of the family were successively represented by Samuel Ladd. 
John, David, Jeremiah, Cyrus. Chester and Harvey. Samuel, the founder. 
came from England in 1649. and settled in Haverhill, Massachusetts. He 
was a soldier in King Charles's army and fought against Cromwell. Chester 
Ladd, the grandfather of Benjamin F., was born in Burlington. Xew York, 
in 1795, subsequently moved to Pennsylvania, and then to Rockford, Illinois, 
where he spent the rest of his life. He was a pioneer farmer of Rockford, 
and served the community in the capacity of preacher. His wife's maiden 
name was Harriet Hammond. 

Harvev Hammond Ladd, the father of the subject of this narrative, was 
born May 22, 1825. in Burlington, New York. After spending his early life 
there, in the neighborhood of Burlington Green, he removed to the oil dis- 
trict of Pennsylvania prior to 1840. before the discovery of oil entitled it to 
that name. There he lived on Oil creek, where Oil City now stands, and 
taught school. At a later date he went to Belvidere, Illinois, where he learned 
the carpenter's trade. From that place he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, 
then a mere village, and became interested in lumber dealing and saw-mills. 
A man of very temperate habits, he was one of the early members of the Sons 
of Temperance. In 1865 he came to \'ineland, when it was a new town, and 
lived there for many years, in the course of which he was able to render effi- 
cient service to the community as a school trustee. He went to Chicago or 
a suburb of that city in 1879, and died there in the year following. He had 
retired from the activities of life some time previously. His intellectual and 
moral qualities obtained him respect wherever he went. Besides the filling of 
the office of school trustee, he also served in the public capacities of alderman.

justice of the peace and commissioner of deeds. In 1850 he was united in 
marriage to Miss Lucinda D. Perry, a daughter of Benjamin F. and Alngail 
(Newland) Perry. 'Sir. Perry's father was a Revolutionary soldier and a 
cousin of Commodore Perry of Lake Erie fame. Mrs. Harvey H. Ladd. 
who was born in 1830, still lives in Vineland. 

Benjamin F. Ladd received the foundation of his education in a little vil- 
lage named Stevensville. where the family lived two or three years before 
going to Appleton. He also attended the Appleton schools, but completed 
his course of study at the Vineland high school. His business career began 
in the office of the \'ineland Weekly, where he learned the mechanical part 
of newspaper work. Afterward he and Obert Spencer, who was in the same 
ofifiice, purchased the A'ineland Journal, which had been started in the spring 
of 1875, but had not been successfully managed. One year later Mr. Ladd 
bought out his partner, and has since conducted it alone. At its inception 
the paper had a very limited circulation, but by dint of hard work and perse- 
verance, it now has a fine circulation for a town of this size. It is not only 
the oldest daily now published in the state south of Trenton, but it is also 
the onlv one left out of the dozen that have been started in Vineland. The 
publication is a six-column folio, except on Saturday, when the amount of 
reading matter is doubled. It is recognized as one of the leading newspapers 
in southern New Jersey, and owing to its large urban and suburban circula- 
tion it is deemed an excellent advertising medium. 

In 1886 Mr. Ladd added a real-estate and insurance business to his other 
interests. The firm name was Ladd & Spencer until the death of the latter. 
Then Tliomas B. Steele was received into partnership, since which the firm 
has been known as Ladd & Steele. One of the oldest agencies of the kind, 
it represents seven prominent insurance companies. Mr. Ladd was one of 
the organizers of the Tradesman's Bank of Vineland, and has been one of 
its directors from the beginning. He erected the buildings used for the 
printing and insurance business, and has been actively interested in other 
real-estate business. He formed one subdivision, dividing twenty-five acres 
and opening up Columbia avenue. In politics he has always been a stanch 
Democrat, and the Journal has reflected his sentiments in regard to party 
issues. He is not an aspirant to political honors. For quite a while he was 
a member of the National Guards of New Jersey and for several years the 
president of the ^^ineland Board of Trade. 

On November 27i. 1878, Mr. Ladd was united in marriage to Miss Julia 
M. Gifford, who was a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Her father, 
Chester C. Gif¥ord. a contractor and builder, moved to \'ineland in early 
manhood. Mr. Ladd has now four children, — Charles Franklin, George

Chester, Mary Belle and Edward Harvey. Although not members, Mr. and 
Mrs^ Ladd most frequently attend the Presbyterian church. Their pleasant 
home, at the corner of I.andis and Columbia avenues, was erected by Mr. 
Ladd. 



ANDREW SMITH REEVES. 

The Reeves family of Salem county. New Jersey, trace their ancestry 
back to three brothers who emigrated from England about 17CX) and located 
first near New York, but soon removed to New Jersey and settled in what is 
now Gloucester, Salem and Cumberland counties. The first record of descent 
is that of Thomas Reeves, born in Cumberland county, February 28, 1728. 
His son, Joshua, born September 5, 1757, was an officer in the Revolutionary 
war, dying June 2y, 1838. From the marriage of Joshua to Catherine Whit- 
aker were born Samuel, Elizabeth, Benjamin Stratton, Thomas, Joshua and 
Catherine, twins, Charles, and Harriet and Maria, twins. By a second wife, 
Rachel Parim, he had two children. — William Garrison and Abigail Mills. 
The former. Ijorn June 12, 1798, died in Bridgeton, New Jersey, in the 
autumn of 1885, being one of the last surviving sons of a Revolutionary sol- 
dier. 

Thomas Reeves, fourth child of Joshua, who married Eunice Bishop in 
1810, removed from Cumberland county to Salem shortly after his marriage, 
and in the spring of 1834 removed to Cincinnati, Ohio, and there resided 
permanently. His children were Daniel B., Charles B., George J., Caroline, 
Mary, Joseph T., John B., Horace B. and Thomas B. It is recorded in an 
old famil}' Bible that Eunice, the wife of Thomas Reeves, began to read 
her Bible through January i, 1872, and finished it May 24, 1873, ten days 
after completing her eighty-first year. In the fall of 1835 Charles B., the 
second son of Thomas, returned to New Jersey and in October of the same 
year married Mary S. Smith and engaged in farming in lower Alloway Creek, 
Salem county. In 1836 he removed to Lower Penn's Neck, Salem county, 
and in 1846 to Elsinboro, where he occupied one of his father's farms adjoin- 
ing that which his son now occupies and where his wife died. He died on a 
farm on the Ouinton road near Salem. By his first wife his children were: 
Eunice, who died at the age of three years; Andrew Smith; Elizabeth, who 
married William H. H. Carll, of Canton, New Jersey; and Thomas, born in 
1847 snd died in his twentieth year. By a second wife, Joanna, nee Stretch, 
his children were J. Morris and C. Hildreth. He was married the third time, 
wedding Amanda Sayers. and by this union one child was born, who was 
named .Vnna S.. and is living. 



96 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Andrew Smith Reeves, a son of Charles B. Reeves and Mary, nee Smith, 
was born in lower Penn's Neck, Salem county, April 3, 1839, was educated in 
the public schools of this county, and has always followed agricultural pur- 
suits. When about three years old he went to live with his grandparents. 
His grandfather dying in i860, the farm was bequeathed to his three grand- 
children, and in 1862 Mr. Reeves became the sole owner. 

This farm, upon which ,Mr. Reeves still resides, one of the finest in Salem 
county, was originally a part of the Fenwick tract and was first obtained by 
Samuel Nicholson, about 1675, who sold it to George Abbott in 1696. It 
remained in the possession of the Abbott family until 1843, when it passed 
into the hands of David Stretch, later to Andrew Smith, and then to its 
present occupant. The original brick house was built in 1704, an addition 
was built in 1724, and it was remodeled by Mr. Reeves in 1876. It stands on 
a rise of ground embowered in trees, placed there by Mr. Reeves and his 
grandfather. In the lawn is a giant buttonwood tree, a relic of the original 
forest, said by the old settlers to have been a big tree in 181 1. It now 
measures twenty-one feet in circumference at its base. 

Mr. Reeves is not only one of the most successful farmers in Salem 
county, but is a prominent factor in public affairs and takes an active interest 
in all that concerns the general welfare of the community. He has held 
nearly all of the public offices of Elsinboro township, was elected to the 
New Jersey legislature in 1867, serving two terms, and was treasurer of 
Salem county from 1878 to 1883. In every official position which he has 
held he has shown marked aliility and given entire satisfaction to his con- 
stituents. 

On February 16, 1859, Mr. Reeves was married to Mary S. Mulford, of 
Lower Alloway Creek, this county. They have had seven children: Charles 
B., Anna L., Richard M., Abner S., Thomas B., C. Loren and Archie Blaine. 
Charles B. died December 8. 1870, at the age of ten years. 



HON. A. H. SLAPE. 



New Jersey has always been distinguished for the high rank of her bench 
and bar. Perhaps no state can justly boast of abler jurists and attorneys. 
Many of them have been men of national fame, and among those whose lives 
have been passed on a quieter plane there is scarcely a town or city in the 
state but can boast of one or more lawyers capable of crossing swords in 
forensic combat with any of the distinguished legal lights of the United 
States. While the growth and development of the state in the last half cen- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 97 

turv has been most man-elous. viewed from any standpoint, yet of no one 
class of her citizenship has she greater reason for just pride than her judges 
and attorneys. The gentleman whose name introduces this review held 
precedence among the prominent legal practitioners of his section of the 
state. He possessed perhaps few of those brilliant, dazzling, meteoric quali- 
ties which have sometimes flashed along the legal horizon, riveting the gaze 
and blinding the vision for a moment, then disappearing, leaving little or no 
trace behind, but rather had those solid and more substantial qualities 
which shine with a constant luster, shedding light in the dark places with 
steadiness and continuity. His mind was analytical, logical and inductive. 
With a thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the fundamental principles 
of law . he combined a familiarity with statutory law and a sober, clear judg- 
ment which rendered him a power in the court-room. 

Mr. Slape was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1836, a son of Wil- 
liam and Susan (Mangin) Slape. His father was an agriculturist and oper- 
ated a farm in the vicinity of Salem, where his last days were passed. He was 
one of the leading citizens of J^Iannington township and was a man of recog- 
nized business ability. In religious belief he was a Methodist and took an 
active part in the work of the church in which he held membership. In his 
family were six children, namely: Albert H.; William, who was a farmer; 
Harry, who was a lawyer of note and at one time ser\-ed as mayor of Atlantic 
City, New Jersey; Newton; Harriet, wife of Rev. William Marks, of Washing- 
ton, D. C. ; and Susan, who is the only survivor of the family, and married 
\\'illiam H. Thompson, of Salem. 

Albert H. Slape acquired his preliminary education in the public schools 
of Salem, later pursued his studies in the Pennington Seminary and was grad- 
uated with honors in Dickinson College in the class of 1858. Entering the 
office of Tlieodore Cuyler, of Philadelphia, he studied law under the direction 
of that eminent attorney until his admission to the bar of Philadelphia in 
1859. He was admitted to practice at the New Jersey bar in 1861, and, open- 
ing an ofifice in Salem, he entered upon a practice which grew to extensive 
proportions and assumed a very important character. For a period of twenty- 
five years he was the prosecuting attorney for Salem, and five years for At- 
lantic county, discharging his duties in a highly creditable manner. He was 
very careful and painstaking in the preparation of cases, thorough and exact 
in his legal research and before court and jury was a most logical and con- 
vincing speaker. He gained a large clientele and his practice embraced a 
connection with some of the most important litigation tried in the courts of 
his district. 

Mr. Slape was united in marriage to Miss Maria Josephine Boon, a daugh- 



lOO BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

her 22. 1846, and is a truck farmer living on the old homestead. He was 
married February 8, 1877. to Sarah E. Crim. by whom he has six children: 
Mary E., born November 12, 1877: Laura, born September 20, 1879; Hance, 
born November 12, 1881: Ralph, born May 18. 1885: Warren, born 
December 2, 1889; and Paul, born April 3, 1899: their father is a member 
of the board of education and is senior warden in St. George's Episcopal 
church. Sarah Maria, born in 1848, was married September 1, 1875, to 
J. Wesley Sparks, a farmer of her native township. l)y whom she has four 
children: Josephine, born in 1876; Elizabeth D., born December 24. 1879; 
Charles Wesley, born September i, 1882; and Harvey, born April 24, 1886. 
Josephine was born in August, 1852, and on the 28th of December, 1892, 
married George H. Biddle, a farmer of Upper Penn's Neck township. 
Thomas T., the youngest son of the family, is the immediate subject of this 
review. The father died June 17, 1879, ^"^ the mother on the loth of 
April, 1890, at the advanced age of seventy-eight years. They were well 
and favorably known and were highly respected by their neighbors. 

Thomas T. Jaquett was educated in the public schools of his nati\e town- 
ship, but left school at the age of seventeen to learn the trade of stone cutter 
at Camden, this state. He remained there three years and then worked 
as a jouneyman until 1881. when he purchased the marble shop of E. H. 
Robbins at Salem, and with his brother Peter conducted the business for 
three years, when Peter withdrew and our subject continued alone. His 
steadily increasing trade made it necessary to enlarge his store, and in 1897 
he erected a large building, which is forty-five feet in frontage and one hun- 
dred feet in depth, giving him greatly increased facilities for handling his 
goods. He handles all kinds of marble from ornamental marble to flagstones. 
He has met with flattering success and has done a great deal of work in the 
surrounding countr}', having been employed on the soldier's monument at 
Camden and on the stone work on the A\'ilmington court house and city 
hall at Camden. 

Mr. Jaquett was married October 11, 1882, to Miss Mary Dare, a daugh- 
ter of George and Phoebe A. (Mattison) Dare, of Cumberland county. Their 
marriage has been blessed by the birth of five children: Efifie, born Septem- 
ber 2J, 1883; George Dare, born November 27, 1884; Frances, born April 
4, 1886; Josephine, bom December 27, 1893; and Robert Kitts, born May 
23, 1895. Like his long line of illustrious ancestors, Mr. Jaquett is promi- 
nent in St. George's Episcopal church, where he has been secretary for six 
years and a member of the vestry many years more, and is one of the most 
widely popular men of the county.

GEORGE DARE. 

The history of the Dare family, which until lately was so little known 
that the Bridgeton and Greenwich branches could not trace their ancestry, 
turns out, like that of other descendants of Adam, to be a long account. 
The l^rst authentic mention that can be found is obtained in Alacaulay's 
Histor^• of England, which gives the particulars of the killing of Thomas 
Dare, who was engaged in the Duke of Monmouth's invasion in iTuSs. The 
direct ancestor of the Salem branch of the family was Captain William Dare, 
who built the first house in Philadelphia, in 1662. It was known as the 
Blue Anchor tavern, and there AVilliam Penn was entertained when he 
brought his colonv to the state which was afterward named in his honor. 
The next vear Captain Dare sold his property in Philadelphia and purchased 
lands of the New Jersey Society at Nantuxit, now Newport, where he lived 
until his death, in 1721. He lived an active and noble life and became 
owner of much property in different parts of the country. He had three 
sons, William, Robert and Benoni, and three daughters, one of whom mar- 
ried Jeremiah Nixon. All of his children had married and left large fanulies, 
and all were prosperous people. 

William Dare, the first, is designated in his first api)ointment as sherift 
of Salem county as "Captain William Dare, mariner." He was the first 
sheriff of Salem' county under the crown, having been appointed by Lord 
Cornburv inunediately after the giving up of their rights by the proprietors. 
In 1 704' he was reappointed, a fact which indicates that his service was 
satisfactory-. He was afterward made associate judge and justice of the 
peace, and was a military officer of the train bands or militia. He was also a 
chosen freeholder, and in one capacity or another was almost constantly 
engaged in public business. His will, a copy of which is now in possession 
of Mrs. Thomas T. Jaquett, shows that he was a native of Dorsetshire or 
Somersetshire, as he leff real and personal property at Lyme, where Thomas 
Dare was landed by the expedition at Yawl, near Taunton, where Thomas 
had raised forty horsemen for service in the Duke of Monmouth's command. 
This inventory is interesting, as showing a glimpse of affairs two hundred 
years ago. He appears as a hearty, practical, active, able and responsible 
person, a careful and tender husband and father and the very ideal of a 
pioneer, not only able to conduct his own affairs successfully but with 
enough brains to do great service to the community. He left a remarkable 
family — each member of it being the owner of many broad acres, upon which 
each raised a large family and became the head of an extensive number 
of descendants at the present day. 



I02 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY Of THE FIRST 

The eldest son, William, seems probably to have been the best cared for^ 
after the English fashion — at least he was left all the property in the old coun- 
try. He lived and died at Indian Fields, near Bridgeton. Cumberland county, 
where he owned a large tract of valuable land, including cedar swamp land 
and water power. This homestead, which was in possession of the family 
continuously until a few years ago, is delightfully situated on the hill over- 
looking a run. near which he had a store, a mill, cooper, millwright and 
blacksmith shops and probably other business interests, for the place was 
a greater business .center than Bridgeton at that time, but navigation at 
Bridgeton left Indian Fields deserted. There is extant an old day-book 
kept there by a Dare in 1776. Daretown was named in honor of this family. 
Benjamin Dare, the son of Benoni. was the grandfather of George Dare, 
whose name introduces this record. He became a prominent man and 
successfully carried on business as a builder and auctioneer. He wedded 
Mary Shepard, a granddaughter of Rev. Job Shepard. His birth occurred 
in 1764. and his death in 1837. Samuel Dare, the father of our subject, 
was born in 1790 and loyally served his coun.try in the war of 1812. His 
death occurred in 1865. In 1813 he wedded Nancy Barker, and they 
became the parents of ten children: Benjamin. Elizabeth. Rachel L., ^^'illiam 
T., ^Maiy, Samuel M., Rebecca B., George, Sarah and Maria. 

George Dare, the subject of this review, was bom in Bridgeton. Decem- 
ber 31. 1828, and married Phebe Mattison in 1851. They had three 
children: Benjamin A., born January 21, 1852: James B.. born May 30, 
1854; and Mary D.. November 16. 1855. The mother died in December, 
1888. and Mr. Dare aftenvard wedded Margaret Kiger. For thirty years 
Mr. Dare carried on agricultural pursuits, but since 1856 has resided in 
Salem and is engaged in dealing in pumps, pianos and organs. His politi- 
cal support was given to the W'hig party in early life and afterward he 
voted with the Republican partv, but is now a Prohibitionist. 



FACTS AND FANCIES CONCERNING THE LEAKES. 

Genealogical items have always lieen of interest to the aged. Init in the 
present day the subject engages the attention of men and women in the midst 
of life's busiest jjeriod. Even the children, unlike most of those of earlier 
generations, deem ancestors to be of importance. This is the token of 
better work in the future. Too nianv. during the more than two centuries of 



CONGRESSfOh^.-iL DISTRICT OF XEJV JERSEY. 103 

family life in this country, have reached the point of inquisitiveness in this 
regard only to realize that those who once could have told them have gone 
into the "silent land." 

These facts and fancies relating to the Leakes are therefore here set down 
trusting they will be helpful to some of the branches, and suggest lines of 
investigation that may lead to a more complete paper in the years to come. 

The name of Leake has not been unknown or unhonored in England. 
It is said that owing to the lack of male representatives, the title finally 
lapsed. It was bestowed in recent years upon Alfred Tennyson the poet. 
William Martin Leake, born in 1777, dying January 6, i860, a lieutenant 
colonel in the British army, and a traveler and writer, has contributed much 
to our knowledge of the ancient and modern geography, the history and 
antiquities of Greece. Henrj' Hoek, or Hook, who went to England from 
Wesel, changed his name to Leeke. To his philanthropic bequest, South- 
wark owes the foundation of the excellent free school of St. Olave's, — one 
of the best of its class. There was a Flemish painter, van Hoek, or Hoeck, 
born about the beginning of the seventeenth century, who may have been 
of the Leake family. 

Tradition says that Recompense Leake, the ancestor of the New Jersey 
Leakes, was a descendant of the Puritans who landed on Plymouth Rock, 
Massachusetts, but the name is not in the lists of passengers who came in 
the Mayflower of 1620, the Fortune of 1621, the Ann and Little James of 
1623. It may have been that his "truly blue" forbear was on the maternal 
side; but it has been noticed that a certain "John Hooke" was among the 
company on the Mayflower. This fact may or may not be of value in con- 
nection with the preceding paragraph. 

A paternal line of a more recent importation mav be the source of the 
name. One of less rigid views whose criticisms may have warped his son's 
mind; for the record, written by Isaac Whitaker, Esq., of Deerfield, New Jer- 
sey (a copy in the possession of Mrs. Caroline W. Van Meter, of Salem), 
reads: "Becoming dissatisfied with the laws and regulations of the New Eng- 
land colonists, he moved to Long Island, where he resided many years and 
accumulated much property." It may have been on account of his health, 
for the air of Plymouth is malarious. To step upon a material rock, after the 
weary, swaying passage, must have been as great a satisfaction to the Pil- 
grims of 1620-3 ss it is to the later Pilgrims who journey there to worship at 
the shrine of the Past; but when one sees the gra\-es that so early dotted the 
hillside it is to wish the landing had been at a more invigorating spot, even 
if less alluring to the eye. 



I04 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

"He afterward settled on Dan ri\-er, North Carolina, where he buried 
his wife and several of his children. Leaving that section, he came to New 
Jersey in a sloop, landing at Greenwich, Cumberland county (now called), 
where he sold his sloop. He went to Deerfield and purchased a large tract 
of land of the West Jersey proprietors, on which he settled himself and his 
following named sons, viz.: John Leake, Samuel Leake, Recompense Leake, 
Nathan Leake." 

He married (a second time) the widow of Jeremiah Miller, by whom he 
had three daughters: Sarah, Rachel and Hannah. Sarah and Hannah died 
unmarried. Rachel Leake married Ambrose Whitaker (or -car) October 5, 
1772. See Whitaker and Van Meter ancestral notes. 

Mrs. Harriet Van Meter Cone, of Salem, New Jersey, contributes the 
following in regard to John George Leake, a descendant of Recompense 
Leake, whose undevised estate created so much excitement more than half a 
century ago: 

■'About 1830 or '35 John George Leake, a wealthy bachelor lawyer of 
New York city, adopted an orphan boy by the name of Watts, intending, 
after the completion of his education and his arrival at twenty-one years of 
age, to have his name changed to Leake by the state legislature. Mr. Leake 
made a will devising his estate to young Watts on those conditions. His 
death w-as very shortly followed by the death of young Watts, and before 
he had reached his majority. The will made no arrangements for this con- 
tingency, or any other disposition of his estate. The facts were advertised. 
Such as could claim relationship were requested by the courts to present 
their claims. Tire only clue which could be gained was from the remark, 
heard from him in life, that his nearest relatives in this country were an old 
couple by the name of Leake, in South Jersey, with whom he did not seem 
to have had any intercourse. 

"Mr. Isaac Whitaker, whose mother was a Leake, was deputed to visit 
New York city, present the Leake claims and gain the estate, if possible. He 
failed, however, to substantiate the relationship. The property went to the 
commonwealth. The legislature, at Albany, decided to invest the avails of 
the estate in founding an institution for orphan boys. Land was purchased 
near New York city, a building erected, an organization formed, and "The 
Leake and Watts Asylum for Orphan Boys" has faithfully performed its 
mission. The city of New York, however, in making its rapid strides, soon 
encircles the asylum and its grounds. The land became very valuable. The 
corporation about to erect the cathedral of St. John made an ofTer for the 
site, which was accepted, and the Leake and Watts Asylum for Orphan Boys 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 105 

was removed to a new location, near Yonkers, where it is still in operation." 

Mrs. Mar>' P. Evans, of White Gables, Maryland, claimed to be a de- 
scendant of Recompense Leake, who she stated was the first of the family to 
come to America. She is reported to have said: "One of the four sons of 
Recompense Leake was James, my great-grandfather. One of the four 
brothers was Robert Scarsdale, the father of John George Leake, the million- 
aire. While Recompense Leake was residing on his farm, now known as Ho- 
boken, his son James left him and went to Marjdand, where he married a 
Catholic lady. One child, James, was my father's father. He died in Ken- 
tucky in 1807. His children were Mary Martin Leake, James Leake, John 
Leake, Richard Leake. Nellie Leake, William Leake (my father), Ignatius 
Leake and Raphael Leake. The heirs of Richard are numerous and are 
located in North Carolina, Georgia, etc., while the heirs of James are to be 
found in Missouri, Kentucky and Maryland." 

It was always maintained by Mr. Isaac \Miitaker that the estate of John 
George Leake rightfully belonged to the South Jersey families, but that 
the records had been in the keeping of the Garrison branch (in Deerfield), 
who had thoughtlessly destroyed some necessary links in the chain of genea- 
logical proof. 

Taking up the line of the four sons who accompanied Recompense Leake 
to Deerfield, New Jersey, the first named is John, who died without issue in 
Deerfield, at the age of ninety-six years. He is spoken of as a man "who 
loved the gospel." The name of Leake is the first mentioned of those who 
were earliest in the records of the Presbyterian church at that place (religious 
services are supposed to date from about 1732). 

Samuel, a son of Recompense Leake, ist, died in Deerfield, New Jersey, 
leaving five children: Samuel, Levi, Aaron, Lewis and Mary. Aaron and 
Lewis left no children. Samuel, Jr., was born in Deerfield, in 1748. Elmer's 
"Reminiscences of the Bench and Bar" state that he graduated at Princeton 
in 1774; was licensed as an attorney in 1776, and afterward was a counselor 
and sergeant. He settled first at Salem, but removed to Trenton in 1785, 
where he resided until his death in 1820. He is described as having a high 
reputation for accurate legal knowledge, of the most sterling integrity and 
being probably more generally employed in supreme court cases than any 
other lawyer. He was an earnest, sincere Christian, belonging to the Pres- 
byterian church; of great simplicity of character and minute exactness, even 
in the most trifling matters. He left several daughters, one of whom married 
the Rev. Dr. Slack, of Cincinnati, Ohio. Levi Leake, the second son of 
Samuel, Sr.. lived and died in Deerfield, leaving two sons and one daughter: 



io6 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Samuel, Lewis, Mary. The only daughter of Samuel Leake, Sr., ^lary, mar- 
ried Jonathan Garrison. There were three sons: Charles, Lewis and Samuel 
Leake. 

Recompense Leake, a son of Recompense, ist, lived and died in Deerfield. 
He left five children: Abraham, Jeremiah, Joseph, Jemima, Elizabeth. Abra- 
ham, a Presbyterian minister, died without issue, during the war of the Revo- 
lution. Jeremiah left three children, — Recompense, Ruth, Sarah. Joseph 
and Elizabeth never married. Jemima married Charles Avery, of Cincinnati, 
Ohio, and left several children. 

Nathan Leake, son of Recompense Leake, ist, lived and died in Deer- 
field, leaving nine children: Eleanor, Amy, Phebe, Rachel, David, Nathan. 
Ephraim, Rebecca, Ruth. Eleanor married John Stratton, Esq., and had four 
children, John, Gilbert, Nathan, Levi. Amy died unmarried. Phebe mar- 
ried William Garrison, Esq., of Deerfield: no children. \Mlliam Garrison 
was married the second time, to Ruth Leake. There were four sons, — 
Charles, George \V., Edmund, Amos F. Charles was a physician, married 
Hannah Fithian and finally settled in Swedesboro. Their son. Dr. Joseph 
Fithian Garrison, was associated with his father in practice. The latter, how- 
ever, gave up medicine for the study of divinity, becoming rector of St. Paul's 
Protestant Episcopal church, of Camden, New Jersey, in 1855. His son, 
Charles Grant Garrison, of Camden, is one of the justices of the supreme 
court of New Jersey. George W. Garrison settled in Salem. At his death 
he was the president of the Salem National Banking Company. He was 
twice married and left two children. Hedge T. and Louisa. Edmund Garri- 
son's home was in Swedesboro. He had a family of children. Amos T. 
Garrison graduated as a lawyer and went to Missouri. Rachel Leake, a 
daughter of Nathan, married Amos Fithian. Their children were Joseph. 
Joel, Charles and Hannah. Joseph settled in Woodlniry, where he was a 
successful physician. He married first Harriet Stratton, and, for the second 
time, Esther G. Cattell. There were two children of the latter marriage, — 
Josephine and Sallie G. The latter died in her youth, and the former mar- 
ried Rev. Edward W. Hitchcock, D. D., then pastor of the American Chapel 
in Paris, France, now of Philadelphia. Joel Fithian married Sarah Sinnick- 
son, of Salem, New Jersey. They removed to Ohio and had two sons and 
three daughters. David Leake, a son of Nathan, married Hannah Shute, and 
they had four children, Mary, William, David and Phebe. Nathan Leake, a 
son of Nathan, married Ruth Garrison. He settled in Millville, New Jersey, 
and left a large family. Ephraim Leake, a son of Nathan, died without issue 
and the compiler of this article has no information respecting Rebecca Leake.

THE REEVES FAMILY. 

The name of Reeves has been long and prominently connected with the 
hi.torv of Cape May county, but the account of the estabhshment of the 
familv- in New Jersey is uncertain. It is believed however that the hrs 
the name who settled in Cape May county were three brother s-Adomjah. 
\braham and \biiah,— who came from Cumberland county m the year 17/- 
o!::tTst o;\.pnl. .y??^ AdomiaU Reeves married Miss Molly Golhfer who 
died on the 17th of April, following, and on the 21st of February, 781, he 
wedded Marv Bellengy. Two sons. Aaron and James, were born to them 
The mother died November 30, 1789, and Adonijah Reeves was marned a 
third time, his last union being with Drusilla Hand, the weddmg takmg 
place November iS, 1790. They had a son and two daughters,-Jerem,ah, 
PoUv and Ruth. Adonijah Reeves d.ed February 8, 1798, and h.s children 
subsequentlv died, leaving no descendants. . , , ,, u^,„ 

\biiah Reeves, another of the three brothers mentioned above was born 
in Cumberland county, New Jersey, in 1750. and came to Cape May com^ 
about 1772. He did not marry until his fiftieth year, when he wedded Miss 
Mercv Hand, of Cape Mav county. They had four sons and two daughters. 
Abraham. David, Andrew H., Joshua H., Sarah and Mercy. The last named • 
died in infancy. The father was a soldier in the Revolutionary war and was 
also a membe; of Captain Joshua Townsend's company of militia m the vvar of 
181'' That companv consisted of brave and hardy men. mured to toil and 
fearless of danger. The stories of the hardships they endured now seem al- 
most incredible, but were then stern reality, and the country wi 1 ever owe to 
them a deep debt of gratitude. Abijah Reeves died in 1822, at the age of sev- 
enty-two, and his wife passed away in 1847, at the age of seventy-four. Both 
were buried in the Cold Spring graveyard. 

\braham Reeves, the eldest son of Abijah and Mercy Reeves, was born 
in Lower township. Cape May county, October 23. 1802, and at the age of 
twenty-five was married to Miss Eliza Widdefield, with whom he lived happily 
until die 6th of November, 1845. wl^en they were separated by the death of 
the wife On the 3rd of November, 1853. he married Miss Manah James a 
most estimable lady, of Dennisville. New Jersey, with whom he lived to the 
time of his death. 'He was a man of fine physique, six feet in height and of 
robust frame. He also possessed a lively and humorous disposition and in 
this respect never grew old. He was the embodiment of that "merry heart 
which is a "continual feast.'" He was fond of young society and young peo- 
ple deli-hted to have him with them, for he entered into then- games and 



io8 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

amusements with almost childlike zeal and enthusiasm. He was familiarly 
and lovingly known throughout the county as "Uncle Abe," being so called 
by young and old. He was generous and obliging to a fault, often contribut- 
ing of his time and money to the comfort and relief of the sick and needy. 
He was a man of more than ordinary ability, of broad mind and public spirit, 
possessed a retentive memory and was a great reader, being especially fond 
of history and biography. His early opportunities for acquiring an educa- 
tion were very limited, both for want of means and of available schools, he 
attending school but little and for only tJiree months when he could study 
arithmetic. Notwithstanding his limited advantages, his scholarly attain- 
ments were not inconsiderable, and this, together with his sound judgment 
and strict integrity, caused his advice and services to be frequently sought 
by his fellow citizens. At the time of his death, although he was eighty-two 
years of age, he was serving his second term as lay judge of the court of com- 
mon pleas of his -county. He was also judge of elections in Lower township 
and ser\'ed as such for twenty consecutive years. He was a Sunday-school 
superintendent and ruling elder in the Cold Spring Presbyterian church, of 
which he was a consistent member, regularly attending its services for more 
than forty years. He was also the chairman of the Cape ^lay County Bible 
Society, of the Cape Alay County Sunday-school Association, of the Farmers' 
and Mechanics' Debating Society and of the Mechanics' Building & Loan 
Association. He served also as a chosen freeholder, township committeeman 
and in other local positions. His well known reliability and probity led to his 
selection to settle the estates of many decedents and to act as the guardian 
of minor children. He was faithful to every trust, and no thought of sus- 
picion was ever breathed against him. In politics he was a Native American, 
then an old-line Whig. In the fall of 1858 he was elected to the general 
assembly of New Jersey, and in 1859 was returned to serve another term, 
and this notwithstanding there were three parties in the field and the old 
Whig party was fast disintegrating and being embodied in the new Repub- 
lican party. 

At the breaking out of the Rebellion, he took an active part in the raising 
of troops and equipping them for the front. His were always words of hearty 
cheer to the "boys," and again and again in addressing them he would say. 
"Stand by the Union right along."' In the summer of 1862, although more 
than sixty years of age. he went to Beverly, New Jersey, with a company of 
volunteers from his county, and with them ofYered his services to the 
government, but was refused on account of his age. He then joined the 
Christian Commission, procured a pass and went to the front, where he 
cared for the sick and wounded, without pay or profit of any kind, except 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 109 

the gratitude of those wliom he comforted and reheved. He was always and 
everywhere "Uncle Abe" to all of them. He died May 5, 1884. and was 
buried in the Cold Spring gra\eyard. Upon his tombstone is the following 
inscription: "Then Abraham died in a good old age. an old man and full of 
years; and was gathered to his people." 

David and Andrew Reeves, second and third sons of Abijah and Mercy 
Reeves, were twins. They were born in Cape May county. New Jersey, 
April 10, 1805. Their resemblance to each other was most remarkable, so 
much so that in infancy a blue ribbon was tied and kept upon the arm of one 
of them, by the mother herself, that she might not mistake them. This strik- 
ing likeness lasted all through life. It was not alone in personal appearance 
but their voices also were as much alike in sound as their features and stature. 
.\musing instances of mistakes made by parties doing business with or for 
one would often be reported to the other, and the party making the mistake 
was generally left to discover it himself some days later! Tliey were men of 
w^ell built and powerful frame, six feet in height, erect and well proportioned. 
They were of active habits, energetic and persevering, of good judgment and 
business tact. Progressive and public-spirited, they encouraged and cheer- 
fully aided every enterprise calculated either to improve the neighborhood 
or to benefit the laboring class by providing work for them. They were 
honest in all their dealings with their fellow men, and said what they had 
to say in plain, unmistakable English. Charitable and benevolent, they were 
good friends to the poor and obliging to all. As in their babyhood, so all 
though life, they were seen together. Their business was in partnership, their 
purchases and possessions joint. Unfeigned brotherly love was never more 
marked than in these men; their souls were truly knit together. In the early 
years of their business career they were largely engaged in vessel building, 
also in moving houses and in getting off wTecked and stranded vessels from 
the beach, and in saving their cargoes and crews, — a dangerous task ofttimes. 
Andrew was for many years the captain of the life-saving crew at Cape May 
Point. They also cultivated large farms, engaged in merchandising and thus 
furnished employment to many workmen. They were always energetic and 
could tolerate no idle hands about them, yet they were not hard taskmasters. 
They were both members of and ruling elders in the Cold Spring church 
and were deeply interested alike in its temporal and spiritual welfare. They 
gave liberally of their time, service and means to its support, and exemplified 
in their daily living their Christian belief. 

David Reeves was married, April 10, 1826, on the twenty-first anniver-. 
sary of his birth, to Letitia B. Biers, and they Ijecame the parents of three 
sons and two daughters: Abijah Davis, Abraham Baldwin. Courtland \'an 



no BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Renssalaer, Elizabeth and Mary Rhoda. The mother died August 15. 1841, 
and in May. 1843, David Reeves married Tryphena Hand, by whom he had a 
son, -»Ioses W'ilHamson. After a busy and useful life Mrs. Tryphena Reeves 
died, October 12, 1868. and David Reeves passed away October 4, 1876. at 
the age of seventy-one and a half years, both being buried in the Cold Spring 
churchyard. 

Andrew H. Reeves, twin brother of David, was married to Isabella }ilat- 
thews, January 30, 1834. Their children were: Andrew H.. who died in in- 
fancy; Clement B., born August 26, 1835; Emma Rush, who died in infancy; 
Samuel W., who was born October i. 1839; Mary E.. born July 18, 1841; 
William H.. born January 17. 1843: Charles C: Emma J., born May 30, 
1848; and Charlotte M., born October 15, 1850. Isabella M. Reeves was a 
true wife, a fond mother and an earnest Christian woman. She loved the 
church of her choice, — the Presbyterian, — and stood ready to make any sacri- 
fice for its good. She died June 23, 1861. and was buried in the Cold Spring 
churchyard. On November 8, 1865. Andrew Reeves married Mrs. Eliza 
Hand, the widow of Aaron Hand. She died March 16. 1867. and Mr. Reeves 
departed this life February 5, 1875. Like the others of the family, his remains 
were interred in the Cold Spring churchyard. 

Joshua H. Reeves, the fourth son of Abijah an^ Mercy Reeves, was born 
in Lower township. Cape May county, July 22. 1808. and at an early age was 
apprenticed to Isaac Whildin to learn the shoemaker's trade. He completed 
his apprenticeship, but as the work did not agree with him he then accepted 
a position as a farm hand. At the age of thirty-two he joined the Presby- 
terian church. He was a man of the strictest integrity and honorable in all 
his dealing. He was a kind father, but strict in family discipline; was care- 
ful in his dress and always neat in his personal appearance. A strong advo- 
cate of temperance, he was an active member of the order of Sons of Tem- 
perance. He was one of the first scholars in the Cape May Sunday-school, 
was always a worker in the school, and it was largely through his efforts 
that it had an existence. It stands now as a monument to his Christian de- 
votion, — more desirable than any monument of stone could l)e. At the time 
of his death he was serving as the superintendent of the Sunday-school. 

Joshua Reeves was married to Eleanor ^^'oolson. January i, 1833. and 
to them were born seven sons and four daughters: David, born October 15, 
1833; Swain S., born July 17, 1836; Andrew H.. born May 26, 1838; John 
W., born December 31. 1840; Charles W.. born January 11. 1842: Joshua

yard. 

Sarah Teal, a daughter of Aliijah and Mercv Reeves, was born April 5, 
181 1, and became the wife of Jacob Teal, August 27, 1830. She has for 
many years been a consistent member of the i^Iethodist church and is still 
interested and active in church and Sunday-school work. Her life has been 
a busy and useful one, and she is the mother of four children: Adaline Mat- 
thews, Lydia Hand, Eliza B. Shaw and Tryphena Matthews. 



LOREN P. PLUMMER. 

Loren P. Plummer, the surrogate of Salem county. New Jersey, is a 
gentleman of pleasant address and affable manner which have made him an 
unlimited number of friends throughout the surrounding country where he is 
well known. He is a son of William and Rebecca (Carll) Plummer and was 
born at Canton, this county, September 12, 1857. He has resided in Salem 
since his boyhood and his upright, manly bearing and honorable dealings in 
all transactions have caused him to be regarded with favor Iiy his employes 
as well as the general public. 

His father, William Plummer, Sr., is one of the county's most substantial 
and esteemed citizens and like the son is a native of the county. He was 
born in Lower Alloway Creek township Januan,' 17, 1818, and developed 
into one of the shrewdest business men of Salem county. He was at one 
time the proprietor of a general country store at Canton and later dealt in 
hay, feed, etc., in this city, purchasing valuable property along the wharf 
which he still holds, and owning a sloop that carried merchandise between 
Salem and Philadelphia for many years. He is still actively engaged in busi- 
ness, managing all his interests in the most able manner, although he is 
now in his eighty-first year. He married Miss Rebecca Carll, by whom he 
had five children: Elizabeth K., deceased, Mrs. George Hires; Sarah, Mrs. 
George R. Morrison; Rebecca, Mrs. Benjamin Patterson; William, Jr., and 
Loren, our subject. The mother died in December, 1881. leaving a wide 
circle of friends who felt her death to be a personal loss. 

Loren P. Plummer was educated in the Salem public school and then en- 
tered his father's store, where he clerked for a short time; but, not finding 
the work of a salesman congenial to his taste, he turned to railroading as 
being less confining and more tO' be desired. He began as a baggage-master 
and in 1880 was made a conductor on the train running between Camden 
and Salem, a position he held for seventeen years. He was considered to be 



112 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

the most popular conductor that ever ran on that road, and the popularity- 
has followed him in his other lines of employment. He was a salesman of 
the store of ^^'anamaker & Brown, large clothiers of Philadelphia, for a year, 
and was then elected surrogate of Salem county for five years, the position 
he now holds and the first he would accept from the people. He belongs 
to the Knights of Pythias and in 1886 was a delegate of the Order of Rail- 
way Conductors to Denver, Colorado. He was married November 17, 1898, 
to Miss Elizabeth H. Armstrong, a daughter of James S. Armstrong, the 
agent of the \\'est Jersey Railway, located at Salem. 



SAMUEL W. REEVES. 

For almost a third of a century Mr. Reeves has given to the professional 
duties that fall to the lot of the legal practitioner a close and undivided at- 
tention. He became identified with the bar of Philadelphia in 1867. at which 
time the law was to him an untried field; Success and prominence in almost 
any calling lie along the line of patient, persevering and faithful work. This 
Mr. Reeves realized and resolved that if earnest labor could secure success it 
would be his. His career has therefore been characterized by this factor of 
prosperity, and supplementing this are his keen perception, sound judgment 
and natural abilities. There are no other qualities absolutely essential to 
advancement, and upon the ladder of his own building Samuel Winchester 
Reeves has climbed to eminence in the legal profession. 

Since 1865 he has been a resident of Philadelphia, but maintains a sum- 
mer residence in Cape May county, which is the ancestral home of the Reeves 
family. So prominently have the representatives of the name been connected 
with the upbuilding, progress and improvement of this locality that the life 
history of any who bear the patronymic could not fail to prove of interest in 
this connection, and especially so of Mr. Reeves of this review, who is so 
widely and favorably known throughout southern New Jersey, where he has 
quite extensive property holdings. 

He was born in West Cape May, October i, 1839, his parents being 
Andrew H. and Isabella Reeves. The ancestral history appears on another 
page of this work. He pursued his literary education in the private schools 
of his native town, in the West Jersey Academy, at Bridgetown, where he 
remained three years, and then entered the junior class of Princeton College, 
in 1863, being graduated with the class of 1865. Tlie degree of Bachelor of 
Arts was conferred upon him and two years later that of Master of Arts. Upon 
his graduation he became a law student in the office of E. Spencer ]\Iiller, of 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 113 

Philadelphia, who was one of the professors in the law department of the 
University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Reeves accordingly attended the lectures at 
the University and won his degree from that institution. He was admitted 
to the bar in 1867. and continued in Mr. Miller's ofifice as his assistant until 
the death of his preceptor in 1879. He then formed a partnership with J. 
Howard Gendell, and succeeded to Mr. Miller's business. The firm of Gen- 
dell & Reeves has since continued practice and their business has been of a 
distinctively representative character in the civil courts of this district. Their 
office is located at Xo. 1420 Chestnut street, in the Crozer building, where 
they have a fine law library. Mr. Reeves had a broad knowledge of the vari- 
ous departments of jurisprudence, but has always made a specialty of civil 
law, and now has a large clientage, which indicates that he ranks among the 
best practitioners of the city. 

Mr. Reeves has been a resident of Philadelphia for thirty-four years, but 
has a beautiful summer home at Cape May, and owns three farms in that 
locality, including the old homestead property in West Cape May. Visiting 
his native county each summer, he is thus widely known within its borders, 
and has the warm regard of a large circle of friends, many of wliom have 
known him from boyhood. While in college he was a member of the Whig 
Literary Society. Since attaining his majority he has given his political 
support to the Republican party and is one of the stanch advocates of its 
principles. He holds membership in the Tabernacle Presbyterian church, 
of Philadelphia, has been secretary of its board of trustees for thirty years, an 
elder in the church for twenty years, and for a long period superintendent of 
the Sunday-school. 

On the 25th of April, 1872, Mr. Reeves was united in marriage to Miss 
Tryphena B., a daughter of Downs Edmunds, and they have four children: 
Lottie, born June 12, 1873, became the wife of Robert H. Barr, then a drug- 
gist of Philadelphia, but now a resident of Asheville, North Carolina. Jennie 
j\L, born November 23, 1875, died at the age of seven weeks; Harry McCook, 
born in 1877, died at the age of seven months. NelHe W.. born June 23, 1880, 
is now a student in the high school. 

Mrs. Reeves is also a representati\e of one of the old families of southern 
New Jersey. Her paternal grandfather. Downs Edmunds, Sr., resided at 
Fishing Creek, Cape May county, where his birth occurred. He was a 
farmer and had one hundred and fifty acres of valuable land, which is now 
owned by Mr. Reeves. He also engaged in general merchandising at Fish- 
ing Creek and conducted an extensive and profitable business. He was well 
known throughout the community as an upright, honorable man, a loyal and 
public-spirited citizen and a gentleman of firm convictions on the side of 



114 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

morality and right. He held membership in the Cold Spring Presbyterian 
church. His wife, who bore the maiden name of Eliza Stillwell, was a daugh- 
ter of a sea captain. Their children were six in number. Downs. Jr., being 
the eldest. Joanna became the wife of George Foster, a farmer of Cape May. 
Tryphena married Page Crowell, a sea captain, and their children were: 
Aaron D. E., a farmer, who married Jane A. Foster, of ^^'est Cape May; 
Thomas Stillwell, Edward M., Trj'phena C, Anna F. and Sarah Edmunds. 
Abigail became the second wife of Page Crowell, and had two children, — 
Thomas S. and Abigail E. Luther C. married Mary Edmunds, and they 
have a daughter, Roxanna, who became the wife of X. C. Price, a farmer 
and merchant of Cape May city, by whom she had two sons, — William C. and 
Luther E. The former is an attorney at law, was the society editor of the 
Philadelphia Inquirer, and married Carrie Holliday, by w'hom he has one 
child, Marion. Luther E. Price is now on the stafif of the New York Herald. 
Zeruiah E. married James S. Hewett. a sea captain, residing in Philadelphia. 
Their children are Dr. George A., a physician of Philadelphia; Eliza E. ; Mary 
B.; James, a wholesale grocer, of Philadelphia, who married Hannah Bray- 
man, and has five children: James K., W. Montgomery, Mar\' B., Florence 
and George A. Luther E. Hewett, the next child of Captain Hewett, is an 
attorney at law of Philadelphia, and married Nellie Jennings, by whom he has 
two children, Robert P. and William J. Downs E. Hew-ett is a wholesale 
dealer in white goods and notions, in Philadelphia, and married Susan Hall, 
by whom he has three children,— H. Hartley, Anna C. and Downs E. 

Downs Edmunds, the father of Mrs. Reeves, was born at Fishing Creek 
and became a farmer and general contractor. He was associated with David 
and Andrew Reeves in the latter business, they taking contracts for the con- 
struction of and moving buildings, building bridges, light-houses, teaming 
and the wrecking of vessels. He resided in West Cape May and became the 
owner of considerable land in this section of the state. In his business under- 
takings he prospered, his capable management and enterprise bringing to 
him a handsome competence. He was also a leader in public thought and 
movement, taking an active part in public affairs. He was several times 
elected to represent Cape May county in the state senate and left the impress 
of his individuality upon the legislation of the state. He also served as county 
judge for several years and did considerable legal business. His political sup- 
port was given the Republican party, and public opinion accorded him a 
prominent and honorable position in political, social and business circles. 
He was a member of the Cold Spring Presbyterian church, took an active 
part in its work and ser\'ed for many years as a trustee. He was three times 
married, his first union being with Sarah Wales, who died in 1850. Their 



COXGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEJV JERSEY. 115 

children were Sarah E., Eli D. and Tryphena B., the last named the wife of 
Mr. Reeves. For his second wife he chose Ellen Wales, a sister of his first 
wife, and his third union was with Electa R. Hand. The children of this 
marriage are Charles H., Herhert \\'.. X. Perry. Charles H.. Abigail P.. Ada 
F. and Electa H. The father of this family died September i. 1 891. at the 
advanced age of seventy-eight years, and the community thereby lost one of 
its most valued citizens, a man whom to know was to respect and honor. 



ISAAC K. LIPPINCOTT. 

The Lippincott family is not only one of the oldest and most honored 
families in the United States but luis also a similar record in England. The 
name was derived from Lovecotc. which occurs in the Domesday Book, or 
census, made by order of William the Conqueror, in 1086, of lands held by 
Edward the Confessor, in i04i-f>f). This name, of Saxon origin, implies that 
a landed proprietor by the name of Love, was tlie holder of certain estates 
and the house-cote, and hence was termed Lovecote. As the centuries rolled 
awav the family patronymic underwent numerous changes, becoming Lough- 
uyngcote. Lyvenscott, Luffingcott. Luppingcott and finally Lippincott, in 
which latter form it has continued for more than two centuries. 

In 1639 Richard and Abigail Lippincott emigrated from Devonshire, 
England, to Boston. Massachusetts. For several years they endured the 
hardships and fortunes of the little colony at that point, but e\'entually, in 
185 1, were excommunicated for "non-conformity" to the severe rules laid 
down by the local church. They then returned to> England and made their 
home at Plymouth. Devonshire, where the\- later identified themselves with 
the Society of Friends. This sect, then in its infancy, was greatly persecuted 
by the intolerant people of that day, and at last Mr. Lippincott decided to 
cast in his lot once more with the inhabitants of New England, hoping to 
find a home where he might worship God according to the dictates of his 
conscience. Consequently the little family returned to America, and after 
abiding for some time in Rhode Island ultimately removed tO' Shrewsbury. 
Monmouth county, New Jersey. There Richard Lippincott became one of 
the largest patentees of land in the new colony, and won a well merited 
position among his neighbors. He died November 25. 1683, and was sur- 
vived by his widow, whose death occurred in 1697. They left a valuable 
estate, and handed down to their posterity an iionoreil name and a blameless 
life record. 

Isaac K. Lippincott of this sketch is a son of Jesse and Henrietta (Kay) 
Lippincott, the former a native of Haddonfield, New Jersey. He was a plain,. 



Ii6 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

unassuming citizen, devoted to what he beheved to be his duty, kindly and 
just by nature and loved by those who knew him well. He settled in Woods- 
town in 1866, and thenceforth lived retired from active work until his death, 
when he was in iiis seventy-fifth year. He was a consistent member of the So- 
ciety of Friends, and jioliticallv was first a \\'hig and later a Republican. For 
some years prior to his death he was one of the directors in the First Na- 
tional Bank of W'oodstown. His wife, who died at the age of fifty-three 
years, was a tlaughter of Joseph and Mary (Ka\') Kay. The father, who 
was a native of Camden county, this state, was influential in the politics of 
that county in early days, and at one time he was its representative in the 
state legislature. He lived to attain the advanced age of ninety-four years. 

The birth of L K. Lippincott took place in Gloucester county, December 
22. 1855. When he was in his twelfth year he removed with his parents to 
Woodstown, and after his completion of a three-years course at the South 
Jersey Institute. Bridgeton, New Jersey, he started upon the more arduous 
duties of life as the manager of his father's farm. He is still occupied in 
agriculture, though his energies are not confined to this vocation, .\mong 
the numerous enterprises which ha\'e received his substantial support and 
encouragement the following may be mentioned: the Co-operative Caiming 
Company, and also a canning factorv under the firm name of Davis & Lip- 
pincott; the firm of Davis, Coleson & Company, dealers in feed and agricul- 
tural implements; and the First National Bank of Woodstown, elsewhere 
specially referred to. Of this well known institution he is one of the directors, 
and was elected its president, November 26, 1897, as successor to James 
Benezet, deceased. Like his father before him, he is a stanch Republican, 
and takes an ardent interest in the proper management of local and public 
affairs. For thirteen years he served as a memlier of the cit\- council. ele\en 
years of this period in succession. 

The marriage of Mr. Lippincott and Miss Laura F. Dean was solemnized

JOSEPH COOK, M. D. 



Tlie greater part of the three-score and ten years of the life of Dr. Joseph 
Cook, late of Daretown. was passed in Salem county, where he was well and 
favorablv known. His life was quiet and unostentatious, yet it left a lasting 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 117 

impress upon those with whom he was associated, and always for good. He 
took a deep interest in whatever affected the pul)lic welfare, and his influence, 
which was not inconsiderable, was e\'er exerted in a wise and patriotic man- 
ner. Though he has passed to his rewartl, his memory is tenderly cherished 
in the hearts of his innumera1)le sincere friends, whom he endeared to him- 
self by a thousand acts of kindness and love. 

His paternal grandfather, Joseph Cook, was a wealthy and prominent 
citizen of Pole Tavern, holding many local offices of trust and honor, (^ne 
of his children, Marmaduke Cook, was the father of Joseidi, the subject of 
this memoir. His nativity took place in (iloucester county. New Jersey, 
August 25, [825. In his boyhood he attended the common schools of his 
home neighborhood and Pennington Seminary, there laying the fountlalions 
of a fine education, and in 1847 he was graduated in the medical dejjartment 
of the Universit}' of Pennsyh-ania. He at once entered upon the practice 
of his chosen profession; but at the end of about twelve years, during which 
time he had acquired an enviable reputation for skill and general abilit\'. he 
retired from his profession, becoming engaged in other pursuits. He then 
went to Philadelphia, where he emljarketl in the drug business, and in this 
line of endeavor he continued for some three years. In 1866 he retired, and 
came to Daretown, where in contentment he spent the remaining years of 
his life. During the great civil war, his svmpathies were strongly enlisted, 
and subse<|uent to the liattle of Ciettysburg he volunteered his services as a 
surgeon, and for a long period was at the front, doing heroic duty, relieving 
the sufferings of the bra\-e bovs who wore the blue and jiroving himself in- 
valual)le as a physician and nurse. He was a great student, and kept thor- 
oughly posted on everything pertaining to his profession, taking the leading 
medical journals, and in even,' possible manner enlarged his mental horizon. 
He was broad-minded and philanthropic, believing firmly in the great future 
and wonderful possibilities of this country, and his optimistic views upon 
every subject were a source of comfort and strength to all with whom he came 
into contact. For a period of ten years he was the judge of the court of 
common pleas, making a record of which his children have reason to be 
proud. His decisions were intelligent, impartial, and marked by the candor 
and fearlessness which were among his notable characteristics. 

On the 6th of .\pril, 1853. a marriage ceremony was ]ierformed bv which 
the destinies of Dr. Cook and Miss Sarah M. Richman vvere united. She is 
a daughter of Harman and Susan Richman, of Whig Lane, Salem county. 
Two sons and a daughter blessed the union of the Doctor and wife, namely, 
^^'ilIiam, who resides at Philadelphia: Harmon, who died in childhood, and 
Mary, wlui is the wife of Trueman Clayton, of Philadelphia. After a happv

married life of forty-two years" duration, Dr. Cook was summoned to the 
better land l)y the angel of death, tlie date of the sad event being March lo. 
1895. when he lacked but a few months of seventy years of age. 



WILLIAM B. CARPENTER. 

Inseparably connected with the history and development of the early 
colonial life of New Jersey and Pennsylvania is to be found the name of Car- 
penter. — a name that has been synonymous with upright, honorable dealing, 
commercial prosperity and religious advancement. The gentleman whose 
name appears at the head of this article was a highly respected citizen of 
Salem. New Jersev, where man\' generations of the family have lived and 
died. He was born in Elsinboro township, this county, August 17, 1822, and 
was a son of William and Mary (Beasley) Carj^cnter. In the year 1682 two 
brothers, Joshua and Samuel Carpenter, came from England and settled in 
the ])rovince of Pennsylvania. These brothers were leading characters of 
that time and were prominently mentioned in the annals of the province. 
They married and left families to perpetuate their names and to this day their 
descendants are among the most honorable and influential citizens of this 
community, even as their fathers were in centuries past. 

\\'illiam Beasley Carpenter is a direct descendant of Joshua Carpenter, of 
Philadelphia, whose name appears prominently in the earliest minutes of the 
\estry of Christ church, heading the list of vestrymen present at almost every 
vestry meeting until his death in 1722. His son Samuel accompanied him to 
these meetings for the two or three years preceding his death, and the names 
of both are to be seen on the pages of the first cash-book, which is still in 
the possession of the church. Joshua was one of three ap])ointed by the 
vestry, in 1721, to negotiate for the piece of ground lying to the north of the 
original purchase and which is the churchyard north of the present church build- 
ing. Legal documents now in the possession of the Carpenter family show- 
that he was chosen to act for Christ church in taking the title to the land 
upon which the church edifice was built, that his money was used to complete 
the purchase, and that the legal title remains in his name, although the equit- 
able title is in the church corporation. He was opposed to the Quaker style 
of government, although he was a man of exceptionally good standing in the 
communitv. as even his adversaries, the Quakers, admitted; and one of them. 
James Logan, secretary of the province, in writing to ^^■illiam Penn under 
date of August 8, 1704, said of Joshua Carpenter, "He is himself really a 
good man." Penn recognized his true worth in the face of his opposition to 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 119 

the Quakers, and in 1701 named him in the charter of the city of Philadel- 
phia as one of its first aldermen. Three years later he was again elected. 
He was a member of the provincial assembly in 1702, 1706, 1707, 1708. He 
built a charming residence on the north side of Chestnut street, between 
Sixth and Seventh, the grounds of which were laid out in an artistic and 
beautiful manner. He made his will August 27, 1720, and added a codicil 
July 23, 1722, both of which were proved August 2, 1722, and recorded in 
Will Book D, page 325, at Philadelphia. In this will he made his wife, Eliza- 
beth, executrix, and the only child mentioned is his daughter, Sarah, who 
married Enoch Story, who is also mentioned, as well as the two grandchil- 
dren, Robert and Patience Story. From the will of EHzabeth Carpenter it 
is learned that the son Samuel received a good estate during his father's life- 
time, and it is known that he owned a large tract of land in Delaware, One 
of his sons, William, settled in Salem county about 1745, and married Mary 
Powell, a daughter of Jeremiah and Jane Powell. They had four children, 
namely: Man,', who married Jacob Ware; Abigail, who married Edward 
Hancock: Powell, who was a private in the militia and was seriously wounded 
during the battle of Hancock's Bridge. March 18. 1778; and William, who 
was born in 1757 and was the grandfather of our subject. His name appears 
on the muster roll of Captain John Smith's Company. He aftenvard followed 
the vocation of farming in Elsinboro township, was a true patriot, an honor- 
able citizen and held the respect and esteem of all. He came to a violent 
death in 1803 as the result of a runaway. His wife was Elizabeth Ware, a 
direct descendant of Joseph Ware, who came to Salem in 1675. Their chil- 
dren were Samuel, who married !Mary ]\Iason and moved to New Castle, 
Indiana: Marw whose first husband was Thomas Hancock, and her second, 
Samuel Cooper: Abigail, wife of John Goodwin; William, the father of our 
subject; Elizabeth, who married \\'illiam Thompson; Powell, a mason of 
Philadelphia, who married Eliza Slaughter for his first wife, and, after her 
death, Anne Slaughter; and Sarah, who married Joseph Hancock and re- 
sided in Mannington township. Elizabeth Ware Carpenter was born in 1763 
and died in the same year as her husband, 1803. 

William Carpenter, the father of William B., was born April 4, 1792. in 
Elsinboro township, this county, and became one of the most extensive and 
prosperotis agriculturists of the township. He was a careful business man 
and succeeded in a marked degree, accumulating sufficient means to enable 
him to retire from active work in 1847, at which time he became a resident 
of the city of Salem, where he continued to live until death removed him, 
May 13, 1866. He was a man of great executive ability and was chosen to 
fill a number of local offices and for manv vears was a freeholder. His mar- 



I20 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

riage to Mary Beasley was honored by the birth of five children, namely: 
Elizabeth, who was born in 1814 and died in 1896, was the wife of Joseph B. 
Thompson; Powell, who was born in 1817 and died in 1850. married Mary 
Lawson; Morris, who was born in 1825: and John M., who was born in 1827 
and married Annie I. Harvey. 

Abner Beasley. the father of Mrs. William Carpenter, was born in Lower 
Alloway Creek township, this county, and was a son of Morris Beasley, who 
was born in 1727 and died in 1787. Morris married Mary Waddington, a 
granddaughter of William Waddington, who was one of the first settlers, 
took up considerable land in that township. Their children, with dates of 
births and deaths were: Benjamin, who was born in 1753 and died in 1782: 
Walker, who was born in 1755, was a member of the Second Battalion under 
Captain Sheppard and was massacred at Hancock's Bridge, March 20, 1778; 
Hannah, born in 1758; Mary, who was born in 1760 and died in 1836: David, 
who was born in 1766 and died in 1776; Abner, who was born in 1769 and 
died in 1806; Jonathan, who was bom in 1772 and died the same year; and 
Ann, who was born in 1773 and died in 1809. Morris Beasley's father was 
John Beasley, who was one of the first settlers of Lower Alloway Creek. He 
married Hannah Walker and reared James, Morris and Thomas, .\bner 
Beasley, leaving the farm, moved to Salem, where he conducted a large gen- 
eral store and was a popular man of the city. In 1804 he was collector of 
Salem county, also the first treasurer of the Salem Library Company. He 
was a member of the Society of Friends and married Mary Mason, l:)y whom 
he had four children: Mary, wife of William Carpenter; W'illiam, who mar- 
ried Rachel Pettit; Benjamin, who married and lived in Illinois; and Thomas, 
who married Phoebe Gill. Abner Beasley died in 1806, at the age of thirty- 
seven years, and his wife in 1858, at the age of eighty-two years. She was 
one of the descendants of John Mason, an influential citizen and wealthy 
land-owner in Salem's early days. He was appointed a justice of Salem courts 
in 1714 and 1720, and was a member of the general free assembly for West 
New Jersey from Salem Tenth in 17 10 and 1721. Mary (Mason) Beasley's 
ancestry can also be traced to John Smith, of Smithfield, one of Fenwick's 
executors: to John Smith, of Amblebury, who came to Salem in 1675; and to 
Rothra Morris, a member of the Society of Friends and who owned a planta- 
tion of sixteen hundred acres in Elsinboro. 

William B. Carpenter attended the district schools, wherein he received 
his primary education, which was supplemented by stud\' in Clairmont Semi- 
nary at Frankford, Pennsylvania, and in the Friends" school at Salem. After 
his student life was ended he taught school for five terms in his native town- 
ship and then engaged in the pursuit of agriculture, continuing in that work 



CO.XGRESSIOX.-IL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 121 

until 1891, when he put aside the arduous duties of the farm and took up 
his abode in Salem. He. however, retained possession of the farm in Elsin- 
boro and one in Mannington township until his death and was connected with 
other business pursuits, being a director of the Farmers' Mutual Life Insur- 
ance Company from 1865 and its president for ten years, having succeeded 
Judge Bilderback in that office. 

Mr. Carpenter was twice married, his first wife Ijeing Miss Martha Gaskill, 
of Columbus, New Jersey. Their wedding was celebrated December 8, 1846, 
and seven children were born of their union, namely: Howard, deceased; 
Mary, wife of Edward Lawrence; William, deceased; Lucy G., at home: 
Anna, wife of A. Weatherby; Martha, wife of Edmund Nieukirk; and Re- 
becca, deceased. After the death of his first wife, Mr. Carpenter married 
Nancy A., daughter of Robert Pease, a farmer of Somers. Connecticut. They 
were married June 4, 1868, and three children were born to them, namely: 
William H., a physician; Julia A. and Fanny P. 

Mr. Carpenter attended the meetings of the Friends' Society, and in 
politics he affiliated with the grand old Republican part)'. He has held most 
of the township offices, ha\ing served as freeholder, collector and assessor. 
In 1874-5 he was a member of the general assembly and was tendered the 
nomination for senator but refused the honor. In business affairs he enjoyed 
an unassailable reputation, and his broad capability, excellent management 
and keen discernment, combined with untiring industry, brought to him a 
comfortable competence. He enjoyed the deserved esteem and respect of 
his fellow men, having the warm friendship of many of his acquaintances. 
His life's labors were ended in death December 22. 1899, and his remains 
were interred in the East View cemetery at Salem. 



ENOS RICHMOND. 



Enos Richmond, of Elmer, Salem county. New Jersev, for many years 
prominent in the department of justice and at present one of the county's 
most progressive and influential agriculturists, was a soldier of the army for 
the suppression of the rebellion, in which he rendered his country invaluable 
aid. He was born in Schoharie county. New York, April 11, 1835, and is a 
son of Richard Richmond, who was born at Hyde Park, Dutchess county, 
New York. The grandfather, Cyrus, was born at Poughkeepsie, that state, 
and was a son of Benjamin Richmond, a native of Taunton, Massachusetts. 
John Richmond was one of two brothers who came from Devonshire, Eng- 
land, to seek an asylum in this country from the religious persecution suf- 



122 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

fered by the Quakers, to which reHgious sect they Ijelonged. They settled 
at Martha's Vineyard and later John moved to Taunton, Massachusetts, 
where he was the first white settler. They were all tillers of the soil for many 
generations, and were an industrious, hard-working family. 

Richard Richmond moved to Schoharie county. New York, when a young 
man and was a school-teacher in his earlier manhood. He was joined in 
matrimony to Miss I-ydia Brainard, a daughter of Jesse Brainard, of Con- 
necticut, and had twelve children, seven of whom are still living to perpetuate 
his name and memorj'. They are Asenath Este, of Pownal, Vermont; De- 
light, now Mrs. Jonas Evans, of Pittsgrove, New Jersey; Leonard, a resident 
of West Sand Lake, New- York; Nancy, unmarried, also living there; EfTey, 
wife of Chris Welker, of West Sand Lake; Enos, our subject, and Isaiah, of 
Virginia. 

Enos Richmond attended school until his tenth year, when he entered 
a cotton-manufacturing establishment, where he remained five years, leaving 
it to learn the trade of carriage-maker, at which he worked three years. He 
was then in his eighteenth year and he started in business for himself, running 
a planing mill and carriage manufactory. He first located at Manchester. 
Vermont, and in 1854 went to Berryville, Virginia, and conducted the same 
line of business there for a few years, being successful. His brother Cyrus 
joined him in 1859. However, at that time the country was in a state of 
turmoil over the slavery question and all the northerners were regarded with 
suspicion by the people of that state, violence being resorted to in many cases 
to rid the place of an undesirable occupant ; and excitement ran so high that 
it was unsafe to continue there; so Mr. Richmond moved to Harper's Ferry, 
in March, 1862, leaving his business and ten thousand dollars in accounts be- 
hind him. He returned in 1865, after the war, and tried to dispose of his busi- 
ness and accounts, but was unsuccessful, and was obliged to lease his property 
and leave on account of being in the federal army. In September, 1862, his 
brother was taken prisoner and was one of the few men shot and killed at 
Libby prison, — shot by a guard for looking out of a window. Tlieir sus- 
picions that Mr. Richmond was a sympathizer with the north were well 
founded, as his aid to the government did not wait for accomplishment until 
the breaking out of the war. In April. 1861, he chanced to be at Harper's 
Ferry, a short distance from where he lived, when a friend, a northern man 
but a quartermaster in a Virginia regiment, showed him a telegram just re- 
ceived from those in authority ordering him to have wagons, etc., in readiness 
the following night, as it was the intention of the "Johnnies" to capture the 
arsenal at that point and secure the thirty thousand stand of minie muskets, 
etc.. stored there. After reading this message Mr. Richmond started for 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF A"£/f JERSEY. 123 

home, but as soon as he was out of sight lie turned and took another road, 
which enabled him to reach the arsenal in the shortest possible time and give 
notice to the commanding officer of the expected attack. The officer notified 
:he authorities at Washington, who. in turn, authorized him to blow up the 
arsenal, if necessary, rather than have it fall into the hands of the enemy, — 
which was done. Mr. Richmond then went to Harper's Ferr}' and enlisted, 
was placed in the secret-service department and was of great assistance, as 
he was familiar with the people of the country. He enlisted in the Twenty- 
eighth Pennsylvania \'olunteers. General Geary's regiment, at Harper's Fer- 
ry, and was detailed to duty under McClellan, Hooker, Banks and other 
generals, serving all through the war. He was captured by the guerrilla 
Mosby, on January 25. 1863. but escaped after the first night. 

After the war closed he returned to ^^irginia and settled up his business 
as well as he could, and iii 1870 entered the employ of the government as a 
special agent for the southern-claims commission, serving nine years — as 
long as the commission existed — and traveling all over the south, settling 
up claims caused bj' the war. In 1880 he was transferred to the department 
of justice — also as special agent — and one year later to the French-American 
claims commission. He served there two years and then returned to the 
department of justice until 1885. In 1886 he purchased his present fann of 
one hundred and thirty-five acres and took up his residence upon it, but the 
following year the department of justice again sent for him and he went 
south, serving under President Cleveland until 1888. when he returned 
liome. He investigated thirty thousand cases on the above account: so it 
will readil}' l>e seen that his position was a responsible one. He was the first 
appointed and the last to leave the commission, from which fact it may be 
inferred that he understood and fulfilled the requirements of the position. 
Besides the farm upon which he now resides, he also owns one in Virginia, 
.^nd his success as a farmer is no less marked than his public career. 

He has been married twice, wedding for his first wife Miss Kate Osborne, 
who died in 1872, leaving four children: Willard; Richard, of Philadelphia; 
Mary, at home, and Lydia, wife of Allen Foster, of Daretown, New Jersey. 
On the 26th of March, 1877, he married Miss Hester H. Davis, and by this 
lUiion has two children. — Olive J. and Edith. Mr. Richmond is a Quaker, 
or Friend, in religion, and a memljer of Berryville Lodge, Xo. 148, F. & A. 
M., in which he was at one time the junior warden. He is a man of small 
stature, keen-eyed and alert, and one of the most substantial and popular 
men in the community. He has a fine herd of registered Jersey cattle on 
liis farm, whose record as butter-producers cannot be surpassed. 



124 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



R. M. HITCHNER. 

R. M. Hitchner. ex-judge of the common-pleas court and a venerable and 
esteemed resident of Elmer, Salem county, has seen many and important 
chang-es take place in the county during the seventy years he has lived here. 
His reminiscences of the early days of the county are highly interesting, and 
probably better than most persons does he understand and appreciate the 
hardships and sacrifices necessary to bring it to its present state of perfection 
and prosperity. That he assisted materially in bringing about many of the 
improvements it needs but a brief glance at his history to show, and the gen- 
erous public spirit and desire to promote the city's welfare which was shown 
by him in those days is still a leading characteristic of the man. He first 
opened his eyes to the light of day in a house that stood near the site now 
occupied by the Presbyterian church, on February 20, 1828, in the family of 
David and Margaret (Sithen) Hitchner. 

David Hitchner was a son of Jacob Hitchner. one of three brothers — 
Jacob, George and Martin — who came from Germany to this country. He 
was a fanner of this locality, owning a large acreage which included the vil- 
lage site, the house standing near the Presbyterian church and the barn oc- 
cupying the ground now covered by that structure in the heart of the village. 
The population of the borough at that time numbered thirteen souls and is 
well remembered by the subject of this biography. David was a man of re- 
ligious training, a member of the Methodist Episcopal church and a conscien- 
tious, hard-working man who rose to prominence and accumulated consider- 
able property through his untiring industry and perseverance. He died in 
1875 and left to his heirs four hundred acres of land, part of which is the site 
of Elmer. He was married to Margaret Sithen at the old "Pole Tavern." 
and for many years they journeyed through life together, sharing each other's 
joys and sorrows until death called the wife to the better land in 1872, and 
three years later she was followed by the loving husband. She was a daugh- 
ter of Enos Sithen. a very prominent man of Salem county. Her brother 
David was also a man who was prominent and held many local offices, and 
was afterward elected to a seat in the legislative halls of his state. The living 
children of David Hitchner and wife are: Judge Hitchner; Hiram, a farmer 
near here; Elizabeth, Mrs. Elijah Eastlake. of Deerfield; Mary Jane, Mrs. W. 
C. Keane, of Camden; and Dr. C. F.. a practicing physician of this village. 

Judge Hitchner received a good common schooling in the district schools 
of his native town. At the age of eighteen he engaged in teaching and con- 
tinued at this employment six years during the winter months, while his sum- 




(^. M/. ,)^^5:^/-^ 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEIV JERSEY. 125 

mers were spent in farming. Later he gave up teaciiing' and devoted his en- 
tire time to farming, and in 1854, more than forty-five years ago, he huilt the 
residence in which he now resides. The home farm at Ehner contains one 
hundred and seventy-five acres, and five other farms, one in Upper Pittsgrove 
township of one hundred and sixty-five acres and four in Pittsgrove township, 
aggregate about three thousand acres, mostly tillable land. 

He is a stanch Democrat and has held several ofifices in the gift of the 
people. In 1858 he was elected the town clerk, holding the office three years, 
was the assessor three years, a committeeman twenty-five years and a justice 
of the peace thirty years. In this office he has endeavored to temper justice 
with mercy, especially in the case of youthful offenders, that they might be 
rescued from their erring wa}'s and become good and useful citizens; and 
many a young man has reason to bless the kindly heart that prompted the 
words of fatherly advice. He was the judge of the common-pleas from 1884 
to 1894 and has also been a notary public for many years. For over twenty- 
five years he has been the president of the Elmer Mutual Building & Loan 
Association. He is one of the directors of the Cumberland Mutual Fire In- 
surance Company, of Bridgeton, New Jersey, and director of the Bridgeton 
National Bank since its organization fifteen years ago. He was the mayor 
of the town for one year to fill a vacancy and has often been solicited to run 
for the office, but has invariably refused. He was in the city council three 
years, and in his younger days was an acti\e worker in the cause of temper- 
ance. In 1872 he allowed the use of his name for the legislature, but as he 
made but little effort to secure the election for himself he w-as defeated. 

About December 2y, 1850, occurred the marriage of Judge R. M. Hitch- 
ner and Miss Elizabeth A. Garrison. She was a daughter of Samuel Garrison, 
an old settler and prominent Methodist of Pittsgrove township, who was a 
member of the legislature several tunes. Almost fifty years of happy married 
life had been granted this worthy couple, and on June 9, 1897, just as they 
were approaching the golden mile-stone, in the midst of family and friends, 
death snapped the silver cord that bound them and the beloved wife entered 
into her eternal rest. The children who are left to solace the father's de- 
clining years are: Joseph, educated in the South Jerse\' Institute of Bridge- 
ton and has been the telegraph operator and agent of the West Jersey Rail- 
way at Elmer since 1873; John F., a farmer resident of this vicinity; Phoebe 
C, who married Omer H. Newkirk and is a resident of Friendship, this 
county; Anna M., at home; and Harriet 1., who married Charles H. Gibson. 
Judge Hitchner is a remarkably well jireserved man and still takes pleas- 
ure in contributing to the advancement of the business interests of Elmer, and 
any worthy object is certain of meeting his ready sympathy and aid. The

building fund of tlie new Preslnterian churcli was increased to a large extent 
through his generosity, although he is an attendant of the Methodist Epis- 
copal church and was the president of the board of trustees when that organi- 
zation erected their new house of worship. He has spent a good deal of 
money in his efYorts to bring various enterprises to this place, and with a few 
others offered a large bonus to prospective manufacturers in order to induce 
them to start in business here. He has the entire confidence of the public 
and his services have been in demand in settling up estates. His business life 
has been crowned with success and he to-day owns more land than any man 
in the county. 



J. P. CHEESMAN. M. D. 

Dr. Cheesman. a prominent homeopathic physician of Elmer. Salem 
county, was born August lo, 185 1, in Bridgeport, Gloucester county. New- 
Jersey, where he grew to manhood. He is a son of Nehemiah and Rachel 
(Atkinson) Cheesman and a grandsori of Ephraim Cheesman, of English 
descent. Nehemiah was bom in Swedesboro. Gloucester county, and be- 
came a prominent farmer of that community. He was a zealous worker in 
the Methodist church, acting as a class-leader and steward for over forty 
years. He was a firm believer in the doctrine promulgated by the old church 
and regulated his life in accordance with the strict laws of that organization, 
was one of the pillars of the church, and was always found at the head of the 
meetings. He died in 1881, leaving six children, namely: Rev. H. N. Chees- 
man, who died January 9, 1894; Eli; Dr. John P., our subject: Drusilla R., 
Anna H. and George M., — the three last being occupants of the old home- 
stead. 

Dr. J. P. Cheesman attended the puljlic schools of Bridgeport in his 
youth and later took private instructions. Having decided to make the 
study of medicine his profession, he entered the Hahnemann Medical Col- 
lege, of Philadelphia, graduating in 1879, and at once came to Elmer, where 
he began the practice of his chosen profession. He at once took a great 
interest in all public affairs and made many friends on account of his public 
spirit and friendly disposition, at the same time displaying a knowledge and 
skill in his practice that showed the finished student and called forth the 
w-onder of those who were new to that school of medicine. His success was 
assured from the start, ant! his practice now includes the best and most 
lucrative in the village, many of those who held aloof at first being now 
among its strongest advocates. He keeps himself posted up to date on med- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEJV JERSEY. 127 

ical questions and is skilled in his practice, the most gratifying results attend- 
ing his ministrations. 

Dr. Cheesman was first married, March 6, 1875, to Miss Clementine F. 
Young, a daughter of 'SI. P. Young, of Swedesboro, New Jersey. After 
their marriage they moved to Camden, this state, where she died, in August, 
1876. At the latter place a son was born, May 10, 1876, and named Walter 
C, who on growing up became a post-graduate of the Elmer (New Jersey) 
public school, after which he graduated with honors at the South Jersey In- 
stitute, of Bridgeton, this state. After four years of study at the Hahnemann 
Medical College, of Philadelphia, he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medi- 
cine at that institution. Since then he has taken two post-graduate courses 
in Philadelphia hospitals, is now located on Havreford avenue, and gives 
promise of becoming a skillful practitioner. 

The subject of this sketch, Dr. J. P. Cheesman, was again united in mar- 
riage, April 10, 1879, with Miss Sue B. Hannold, a daughter of William H. 
Hannold, a leading citizen of Swedesboro. By this marriage there are two 
children: William Hannold, born November 16, 1881, who was the valedic- 
torian of his graduating class at the Elmer high school and was a graduate 
in the class of 1900 in the preparatory department of the Temple College, 
of Philadelphia, where his name has been placed on the roll of those who 
have the highest averages: and Clementine Frances, born May 7, 1883, who 
was the salutatorian of the 1900 graduating class at the high school of her 
paternal home. 

Dr. Cheesman is one of the most energetic citizens of Elmer; is a great 
friend of education, and consequently has been chosen to serve on the board 
of education, where he proved very efficient. He has always taken an active 
part in church work, being now the treasurer of the Methodist Episcopal 
church, which office he has held for the past twelve years. For several years 
he was the leader of the church choir and superintendent of the Sunday- 
school, and he considers nothing a sacrifice that will further the cause of 
religion. 



WILBERT B. HITCHNER. 

One of the best known citizens of Salem countv is the gentleman of 
whom this sketch is penned; but in this particular, his father, Elam Hitchner, 
probably surpasses him. The latter, who' is yet living, his home being in 
Woodstown, is one of the veteran stage-drivers of this region, who for years 
conveyed travelers to Penn Grove, Yorktown, Woodbury, Red Bank and 
other points, to various towns along the route he followed. Thus he became 



128 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

known to the people, far and near, and his steriing integrity, kindly, cheerful 
manner, and accommodating disposition rendered him a general favorite and 
a welcome visitor wherever he went. Born on the 2ist of December, 1821, in 
Greenville, New Jersey, he is now approaching four-score years, but his 
mind and memory of past events and experiences are clear: and he is an en- 
tertaining converser, relating numerous stories of men who have passed 
from this earthly stage, but who often traveled with him to and fro on errands 
of business or pleasure. In his early manhood he learned the trade of a 
wheelwright and pursued that occupation during a ]jart of the "408, nor did 
it come amiss to him after he started his stage line. 

Elam Hitchner is the only surviving son of John and Barbara (Martin) 
Hitchner, the former born at Greenville, New Jersey. His only living sisters 
are Eliza, the wife of James Reed, of Elmer, and Salome Sithens, of Philadel- 
phia. Those who have passed to their reward are Harriet, formerly the wife 
of James Avis, of Deerfield, New Jersey; Margaret, the wife of Preston Lip- 
pincott, and Henry and Jacob. Martha Hitchner, tlie mother of our subject, 
was the daughter of Jacob and Rachel (Dilks) Park. 

W. B. Hitchner was born in Woodstown, Salem county, July 5, 185 1, 
and when he arrived at a suitable age lie was sent to the public schools of 
that town, there acquiring an excellent education. He made the most of his 
opportunities, and was only seventeen years old when he obtained a certifi- 
cate to teach. After teaching for a period he took up the business of grocer 
in Woodstown, and continued in that line for nearly six years. During the 
Centennial year he bought the Yorktown stage line of Wm. Richmond and 
ran stages until February, 1883, when the first passenger train went over 
the Woodstown & Swedesboro branch of the West Jersey & Seashore Rail- 
road, then newly completed. In 1884 he acted as the head clerk in the 
general store of Joseph Reading for a few months, at the expiration of which 
time he purchased a coal business in Woodstown, and since has added a 
full line of lime, cement, fertilizers and similar necessaries. He has built up 
an excellent business and enjoys not only the patronage but also the confi- 
dence of the public to an enviable degree. He is a director and treasurer 
of the local building association. In the Baptist church, of which he is an 
earnest member, he is a deacon and serves as the president of the board of 
trustees. 

On the 29th of January, 1879, Mr. Hitchner married ]\Iary E. McAl- 
tioner, daughter of Joseph and Mary Ann McAltioner, but their life to- 
gether was of brief duration, as she was summoned to the silent land March 
24, 1880, when but twenty-two years of age. Tlie second marriage of Mr. 
Hitchner took place January 2/, 1889, Miss Hannah S. Ree\e, daughter of 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 129 

Elmer and Mary Ann Reeve, of W'oodstown, being the lady of his choice. 
They have become the parents of four sons, namely: Howard Cleveland, 
Elmer Reeve, George McAltioner and Elam Martin. 



CHARLES D. LIPPINCOTT. 

This gentleman, who is the senior member of the firm of Lippincott & 
Gaskill, merchants of Swedesboro, w^as born in Harrison township. Glouces- 
ter county, New Jersey, September 18, 1841, and is a son of Chalkley and 
Phoebe (DeuU) Lippincott, also natives of Harrison township, who died in 
1880, the former of whom was aged seventy-six years. He is a great-grand- 
son of Aaron Lippincott and great-great-grandson of Benjamin Lippincott. 
who with his brother Caleb were sons of Jacob Lippincott. The latter came 
from Burlington county, New Jersey, at an early day and took up a large 
tract of land in what is now Gloucester and Salem counties. New Jersey, 
upon which his descendants located and became extensive farmers. All of 
these children w-ere the posterity of Richard Lippincott, an English Puritan 
who came to Boston in colonial days and who, during some religious contro- 
versy, was driven from that place and returned to England. Later he re- 
turned to this country and settled in Burlington county. New Jersey. He 
had ten sons and his descendants are numerous. 

The father of our subject was born in what is now Harrison township, 
Gloucester county, in 1802 ; he died in Mullica Hill, November 5. 1880. They 
had eight children, as follows: Ann, who married Thomas L. Borden, now 
deceased, of Mickleton, New Jersey: Beulah, who was the wife of Asa Engle, 
of Harrison township; Asa, a farmer in Harrison township; Hope, the widow 
of Benjamin L. Moore, of Harrison township: Adon, a builder and contractor 
living at Asbury Park; Charles D.; Henry, a carpenter residing at Mullica 
Hill, and Amos, a merchant tailor of Asbury Park. 

Charles D. Lippincott obtained his education in the public schools of his 
native township, and as a boy did much hard work on the farm. With many 
of his associates he responded to the call for volunteers when the civil war 
broke out, and on July 29, 1862, he enlisted in Company F, Twelfth New- 
Jersey Volunteers. His regiment was assigned to the Army of the Potomac 
and from the battle of Fredericksburg, December 16, 1862, to the close of 
the war he saw acti\e service. He was several times slightly wounded, and 
although voung in vears so proved his courage and ability that he rapidly 
rose from the ranks until in 1864 he was made captain. When "the cruel 
war was over" he was honorably discharged July 2-^. 1865.

BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



On his return from the army Mr. Lippincott purchased the old home- 
stead on which he continued farming until 1869, when he removed to Swedes- 
boro and engaged in merchandising. In 1893 he admitted his son-in-law. 
S. W. Gaskill, as a partner. They do a general merchandising business and 
have the largest and best appointed store in Swedesboro, their success being 
due not only to the excellence of the stock they carry but also to the repu- 
tation they have earned as upright and trustworthy men. Mr. Lippincott 
is the president of the Heat, Light & Power Company, the Swedesboro 
Water Company and the Lake Park Cemetery Company, and also is the 
secretary of the Lakeside Land Company, all institutions of Swedesboro. 
The fact that his associates have chosen him for these responsible positions 
is sufficient evidence of his ability as a business man, and of his high standing 
in the community. He takes much interest in the science of botany and 
has found time, in spite of his multitudinous cares, to make a thorough study 
and an almost complete collection of the flora of Gloucester county. 

Mr. Lippincott was married February 9, 1866, to Henrietta, a daughter 
of Samuel H. Weatherby, of Harrison township, and they have three chil- 
dren: Luella, wife of S. W. Gaskill, who has one child, Samuel B.; Clarence 
is a salesman in the employ of a mining supply house in Denver, Colorado; 
Martha W. married C. W. Justice and lives in Philadelphia. Fraternally our 
subject is a member of the Osceola Lodge, No. 75, L O. O. F., of Swedes- 
boro, and politically he advocates the principles of the Republican party. 
He is a loyal citizen, interested in everything that pertains to the welfare of 
his community and is always ready to assist in philanthropic enterprises. 



JUDGE HARRY S. DOUGLASS. 

One of the most prominent members of the bar of southern New Jersey is 
Judge Douglass, whose analytical mind, keen perception, sound judgment 
and comprehensive knowledge of the science of jurisprudence have made him 
one of the distinguished representatives of the legal profession in this part 
of the state. He resides in Cape May Court House and is now serving as 
the judge of the common-pleas court. 

He was born in Cape May county, September 24, 1858, and is a son of 
Joseph and May Wood (Garrison) Douglass. His paternal great-grand- 
father, Thomas Douglass, was a native of Scotland, and with his father, .\Iex- 
ander Douglass, came to the United States, locating at Trenton, New Jer- 
sey, where he spent his remaining days. He owned a large amount of prop- 
erty there, and during the war of 1812 he manifested his loyalty to his adopted

land by driving a team in the American army. His son. William Douglass, 
the grandfather of the Judge, was a native of Trenton, and by trade was a boss 
ship-carpenter. He built a number of ships at Goshen, but after some years 
abandoned that pursuit and turned his attention to farming, purchasing land 
on Dias creek, in Cape ^lay county. In his political views he was a Whig in 
early life, but on the dissolution of the party he joined the ranks of the new 
Republican party. He was three times married. By his first wife, ]MarA-, he 
had five children, — Thomas, William. Judy. Marsey and Alarv. Bv his sec- 
ond wife, Deborah, there were no children. For his third wife he chose 
Achsah Hand, a daughter of Recompense Hand, one of the heroes of the 
Revolutionary war. They had four children: Deborah, wife of Thomas 
Sayres; Rebecca, who became the wife of Frank Ludham and afterward mar- 
ried Theodore Corson; Ann. wife of George Benezet: and Josejih. The grand- 
father of the Judge died at the age of eighty-six years, and his wife passed 
away at the age of seventy-five. 

The maternal grandfather. Nelson Garrison, was born in Cape May 
count}-. Xew Jersey, and in his business career followed farming and also 
engaged in business at Cape ^lay Court House as a dealer in boots and shoes. 
He was an enterprising merchant, and his able conduct of his business interests 
brought to him gratifying success. His political support was given the Re- 
publican party, and in his religious belief he was a Methodist. He married 
Eliza L. Leaming, and they became the parents of seven children: Mary 
Wood, mother of our subject; Nelson, a farmer of Erma, Cape May county, 
who married Rhoda Cresse and after her death wedded again; Julia, who 
married James Fowler and after his death became the wife of Isaac P. John- 
ston, a hotel steward in Cape May city; William L.. who wedded Mary 
Sayre and follows farming at Erma; Charles F., who married Phoebe Husted, 
and is a carpenter and undertaker at Cape May Court House; J. Leaminf, 
a farmer of Erma. who married Hattie Cobb; and Eliza, deceased. The 
father of these children died at the advanced age of eighty-five vears, and 
the mother is still living, at the age of eighty-four. 

Joseph Douglass, the father of our subject, was born in Cape ]\Iav county, 
on Dias creek, May 4, 1837. and in the common schools acquired his educa- 
tion. He has devoted his time and attention to farming and has also lieen 
a sea captain. For some time the family re.sided on Dias creek, but for fif- 
teen years their home has been in Cape May Court House. Mr. Douo-lass 
is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, and is a leading citizen and a 
man of sterling worth, who enjoys the confidence and esteem of his many 
friends. He married Miss Garrison, and the record of their children is as fol- 
lows: Judge Harry S. is the e!dest. Theresa is the second of the family. 



13-' BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Nelson G., who is connected with general mining interests in New ^'ork city, 
married Adela ,Mason, and has three children, Granville B., Gideon and 
Theresa. Joseph. Jr.. wdio studied law with Judge Douglass for his preceptor 
and is now practicing at Cape May Court House, was formerly a teacher. 
He married Hannah Stiles, and they have two sons. — Charles and Herbert. 
Eliza G., deceased, was the wife of Captain Robert B. Tliompson, a sea cap- 
tain, residing in Cape May Court House. Gideon H. is also deceased; and 
.\chsah, the youngest of the family, died in infancy. 

Judge Douglass acquired his elementary education in the public schools 
and later attended the Salem Collegiate Institute and Pennington Seminary. 
He studied law with John B. HofTman as his tutor at Cape May Court House, 
and in February, 1886, was admitted to the bar as an attorney, and in 1892 
as a counselor. He at once began practice and gradually built up a large 
business, which connected him with much of the important litigation tried 
in the courts of his district. In 1896 he was appointed by Governor Griggs 
judge of the court of common pleas and is now serving on the bench. He is 
most fair and impartial in his decisions, which show a thorough understand- 
ing of the case and a comprehensive knowledge of the law applicable to the 
points in litigation. He practices in the chancery and supreme courts, and 
is an able lawyer, his keen analytical mind enabling him to determine with 
accuracy the strong facts in his suit, while his power of logic and of argument 
enables him to present these to court or jury in a way that never fails to carry 
weight and seldom fails to gain the verdict desired. 

The Judge also has other business interests. He is a director and stock- 
holder in the Mechanics' & Laborers' Building & Loan Association of Cape 
May Court House, the State Mutual Building & Loan Association, and is 
the secretary and treasurer of the branch, and a general director of the main 
association. He is also a director of the Building & Loan ]\Iutual Life In- 
surance Company of Camden, New Jersey. 

On the 25th of December, 1884, Mr. Douglass was united in marriage to 
Miss Eleuthera Smith, a daughter of James Smith, who was a sea cap- 
tain, Init is now deceased. His first wife died in January, 1886, 
and on the ist of January, 1890, the Judge was again married, his sec- 
ond union being with Marian S., a daughter of Elija B. Wheaton, a retired 
sea captain. They have two children: E. B. and John Branin. 

In his political views the Judge is a stalwart Republican and keeps well 
informed on the issues of the day. He sensed as postmaster of Cape May 
Court House during the administration of President Harrison, but has never 
been a politician in the commonly accepted sense of the term. Socially he 
is connected with Hereford Lodge, No. 108, L O. O. F. ; with Arbutus 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEW JERSEY. 133 

Lodo-e No 170, F. & A. M.. and the Ancient Order of United Workmen. 
He i^'s a consistent and faithful meml^er of the Methodist Episcopal church, 
in which he is now serving as steward and trustee. For thirteen years a dis- 
tinguished member of the legal profession, honored and respected m every 
class of societv. Judge Douglass has long been a leader in thought and move- 
ment in the public life of southern New Jersey. He inspires personal 
friendship of unusual strength, and all who know him have the highest ad- 
miration for his good cpialities of heart and mind. 



CHARLES F. HITCHNER, ^I. D. 

The gentleman whose sketch it is our privilege to present to our readers 
on this page has been inseparably connected with the prosperity and up- 
building of the thriving little village of Elmer for many years, and has done 
more than anv other citizen to give it a standing in the commercial world. 
He was born March 14, 1844, on the old homestead which later became the 
town site and has always retained an affection and interest in the prosperity 
of the place that lias led him to put forth every effort for its development and 
success. His father was Daxid Hitchner. who was liorn in Greenville, this 
county, and was a son of Jacob, a native of Germany. David Hitchner was 
reared to a farmer's life and followed it to the end of his days, dying on his 
farm in 1875. He was united in marriage to Miss Margaret Sithens, by 
whom he had five children: Robert; Hiram, a farmer of this vicinity whose 
sketch follows this; Elizabeth, wife of E. S. Eastlake, of Deerfield; ^lary. 
wife of \\'illiam C. McKean, of Camden; and our subject, Dr. C. F. 

Dr. Hitchner spent his early life on his father's farm and was inured to 
hard work. At the age of eighteen years he entered Hudson River Institute, 
as it was his desire to become something more than a mere tiller of the soil. 
Five years at this institution but whetted his longing for a more complete 
education, and he decided to enter the medical profession. He engaged m 
teaching through one winter at Somers Point, near Atlantic City, and then 
went to Philadelphia, where he entered Jefferson Medical College, gradu- 
ating with a class of one hundred and fifty in 1867. He at once returned to 
the home of his boyhood and began the practice of his chosen profession. 
He was efficient and skillful and soon won the confidence of the community 
in his practice, so that he had all the business he could attend to. In 1880, 
after fourteen years of active work, he retired from the professional practice, 
much to the regret of tliose who had come to depend on his skill and judg- 
ment in all questions of bodily ill. He belonged to all the various medical 



134 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

societies and that profession met with great loss when he al)an(lonefl liis 
practice. He inherited one hundred acres of fine land in the town of Elmer, 
near the depot, which is laid out in town lots: and it has been the especial 
care of the Doctor to improve these lots and make them desirable property. 
The streets of the village have been improved by thousands of shade-trees 
set out by his bountiful hand, while the number of manufacturing plants 
which he has induced to locate here is almost beyond belief. The first to 
come was the Cotting Spindle Company, which employs about twenty-three 
men and which located here in 1881, after Dr. Hitchner gave them a bonus 
to do so. Then in the following year, 1882, the McAllister Foundry, employ- 
ing eight hands, was given a bonus and came to this village. Next he do- 
nated the ground and erected a building for the canning factory and induced 
a carpet manufacturing house to decide this was the best field for their j^lant. 
The hosiery factory came here at a cost to Dr. Hitchner of five thousand 
dollars, while the Elmer Gazette owes its start to his generous nature, as he 
erected the building and purchased the machinery to put the infant industry 
on its feet. In 1885 he gave the ground and three thousand dollars against 
five hundred by the citizens, for the Elmer Glass \\'orks, which give employ- 
ment to seventy-five men and are a credit to the community. The Brooks 
Shoe Manufacturing Company also came under his notice and he furnished 
the ground and put up a building for them. The Farmers' Exchange build- 
ing was erected by him and many other enterprises received their primary 
impetus from him and their financial backing as well. Thinking a band 
would be a pleasure and add to the attractions of the village, the Elmer band 
was organized and the instruments purchased for them by our subject. A 
shirt factory was among the industries induced by him to locate here, but 
they were a short-lived concern. He built a hot-house and put in a boiler as 
an inducement for a fiorist to engage in business here and has been a ready 
friend of the community in all cases. Thus it is seen that the Doctor has 
done an immense amount for the village of his home. 

He was joined in matrimony, September 30, 1885, to Miss Emma Dexter, 
a daughter of Charles Dexter, of Mannington township, who was at one time 
a member of the legislature of the state. They have one child, whose name 
is Florence M. Dr. Hitchner was formerly a memljer of most of the local 
fraternal societies, liut has not been in communication with them for several 
years. He was president of the school commission for three years and was 
on the building committee of both the Presbyterian and Methodist churches, 
and has contributed in no small way toward their erection. It can truly lie 
said that he has made the village what it is to-day. and the lo\e and admira- 
tion which is accorded him is well deserved.

HIRA^I HITCHNER. 

Hiram Hitchner is a prominent farmer who resides near Elmer, where he 
was born January 26. 1829. He is the second son of David and ]\Iargaret 
(Sithen) Hitchner. who were well known farmers of this section. He at- 
tended the common schools of his native district and after finishing his edu- 
cation began working on a farm. He resided at Deerfield for a short time, 
and in March. 1872, moved upon the farm of one hundred and twenty-six 
acres now occupied by him. He carries on general farming and keeps his 
place in the most perfect condition, everything showing the thrift and indus- 
trv of the owner. 

He was married, in 1867. to ^liss Martha Kane, by whom he has two 
children: Frank, a resident of Camden, this state, and Bertha, who is at 
home. They are members of the Methodist Episcopal church, in which he 
has been an ofificer many years and where the family are zealous workers. 
They are held in the highest estimation by their acquaintances and are 
among the most influential citizens of the county. 



HAMMOND S. IRELAND. 

Hammond S. Ireland is a leading merchant of Williamstown. Gloucester 
county, New Jersey, and was born in this village. September 8, i860. He is 
a son of Edward S. Ireland, Sr.. who has retired from active business and is 
a highly respected resident of this village. His father, William, was a son 
of Daniel Ireland, who resides in Atlantic county, where William was born. 
William Ireland was a farmer and lumberman and came to this vicinity when 
a lad of sixteen years to engage in that business. He was a leading member 
of the Methodist church, holding all the offices in the organization and was 
in great demand at revivals and other public meetings to lead in singing. 
His wife was Sarah Wear, daughter of Andrew Wear, of Sicklertown, and 
nine children were born to them, five of whom are living, all of this place. 
They are Daniel, Edward S.. Andrew, William Page and Josiah. 

Edward S. Ireland was born May 22, 1823, on the same lot where he still 
lives and has resided during his life. He attended the common schools of his 
native town and began as a wage-earner while still very young. He engaged 
in teaming and lumbering and for years operated a mill from which he drew 
a neat income. He is a veteran Freemason and Odd Fellow, joining the 
Masons at Bridgeton and the Odd Fellows at Glassboro. He is now living in 
retirement, enjoying the fruits of a well spent life. He was a freeholder, sur-

veyor of highways and juryman for many consecutive years. He has been 
married three times, first to Hannah Steelman, who died in 1854; second to 
Anna Beckett, who died in i860: and third to Anna P. Simmerman, who 
died in 1893. These three wives bore him tw'eh^e children, six of whom are 
living, namely: William, a resident of Millville; Edward S., of Mullica Hill; 
Emma, the wife of George Fifer, of this village; Matilda, who is unmarried; 
Hammond S., our subject; and Belle, the wife of Morgan Lutz, also of this 
vicinity. 

Hammond S. Ireland was educated in the public schools but put aside 
his text-books at an early age to do battle with the world. He learned the 
trade of carpenter and did contracting for nine years. \\'hile he was a skillful 
mechanic and took pride in turning out only the best work, yet it was not 
the line of employment which would appeal to him as strongly as some 
other, and he determined to enter the mercantile field. In 1894 he started 
in his present business, opening a stock of general merchandise and building 
up a large trade, which is steadily increasing. 

Mr. Ireland was married Januan,' 27, 1890, to Miss Emily G., a daughter 
of Jonathan Peterson, of this neighborhood, and they have one child, Walter 
C. I. He is a Republican in politics and has taken an active part in the local 
campaigns. He has served as a trustee and the secretarj' of the Methodist 
Episcopal church, to which he belongs, and has been a teacher in the Sun- 
day-school. He was made a Mason at Qayton, New Jersey, in 1891, became 
one of the charter members of Williamstown Lodge and was its first treas- 



JOHX HITCHXER. 



'Sir. Hitchner is one of the representative and reputable farmers of Salem 
county, X'ew Jersey, and has resided on his present farm near Alloway for 
many years. He was born September 3. 1833, at Friesburg. and is a son of 
John and Sarah (Johnson) Hitchner. His father is remembered by many 
of the older residents as among the most prominent of the county's foremost 
citizens. 

The family is of German origin, the great-grandfather of our subject hav- 
ing come from that country to America with his family of four sons and three 
daughters. Among them was ^Matthias, a carpenter, who remained unmar- 
ried. One son settled in what was then Pittstown, now Elmer, and one in 
Friesburg. George John Hitchner was bom in Friesburg, where he con- 
tinued to make his home, was a prominent farmer, and was familiarly known 
as Major Hitchner, having been elected to that rank in the militan,- company

to which he belonged. He was the fotmder of the "Hitchner Tavern," which 
he conducted many years, with marked success, on the premises now owned 
and occupied by John Van Leer. His energetic industry and thrift soon 
placed him among the well-to-do people of that time, and he was highly 
esteemed by his neighbors. He was a Democrat in politics and in religion 
a Lutheran. His first wife was a Miss Miller, who bore him the following 
children: Jacob, George, Martin, John, Mary (Mrs. John Koats), and Mar- 
garet, who was married to Mr. Young. By his second marriage there were 
five children: Mary Ann, Mrs. Jonathan Wood; Sarah Ann, Mrs. Daniel 
Johnson; Lydia Ann, Mrs. Jacob Halter; Samuel and Levi. 

John Hitchner, Sr., the father of our subject, entered into existence on 
the old farm in Friesburg, in 1793, and there grew to man's estate. He 
lived on one hundred and twenty acres of land, from which he obtained 
a comfortable living and iwas enabled to bring up his family in a manner 
befitting his station. He voted with the Democratic party and was a com- 
mitteeman, besides holding a number of other town offices. As a Lutheran 
he was a zealous worker in that body and contributed with a generous hand. 
He married a lady whose maiden name was Sarah Johnson and by whom he 
had twelve children, viz.: Johnson, a farmer, deceased, married Mary Colvin 
and left seven children: Daniel, Neal, Gould, Ed, George, Samuel, who is em- 
ployed in the Bridgeton National Bank, and Mary, who has three children. 
Lewis, who died in 1899, was a well known farmer. He is survived by his 
wife, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Moore, and by his children, — 
Jacob, Scott, Lewis, Lizzie, Peacock, SalHe, Miher and Ruth. Susanna, 
deceased, was the wife of Isaac Van Leer. Christiana married William Rem- 
ster, a miller. Her one daughter, Mary J., married Scott Grice and is the 
mother of two children. Matilda married Jeremiah Watson, a farmer and 
mill operator. Mary Ann was the wife of Benjamin Garrison, a farmer, and 
both are deceased. Eli Fallen married Mrs. Theodosia Pierson and their 
children are William, Frank, Philip, Mrs. Zaiser, Mrs. Hamilton, Ella Erbin

brother and upon which the latter still resides. Then, in 1866, he purchased 
the George Remster property and since that time has operated the mill.

J. D. SOUDER. 



J. D. Souder, deceased, a late and highly respected citizen of Williams- 
town, Gloucester county. New Jersey, by reason of his prominence and char- 
acter, very befittingly finds a place in the biographical history of the com- 
munity in which he lived and labored so many years. 

Mr. Souder was a native of Gloucester county. New Jersey, born near 
Malaga, in 1830. He departed this life in the rich autumn time of 1897, the 
date of his death being October 4th. Lawrence Souder, his paternal ances- 
tor, was born on the old family homestead, in the same section of country 
near Malaga. Of the family of Souders. it should be remarked that three 
brothers came from Germany. One settled here, the other two went farther 
west. Lawrence was a farmer and lumberman. His son. the subject of this 
memoir, spent his youthful days as most boys did in his time, assisting his 
parents, attending the then but poorly organized subscription, and possibly 
district or public, schools, and enjoyed himself in hunting, fishing and taking 
part in the other sports and games of youth. Doulitless he of whom we 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 139 

write was a dutiful and hard-working boy. as tlie sequel of his after life seems 
to conclusively prove this. A shiftless, indolent youth seldom, if ever, ma- 
tures into an enterprising, wide-awake specimen of manhood; hence the con- 
clusion we have drawn concerning our subject's early life rather than from 
any direct data upon which to base our statements. 

The first business enterprise we learn of our subject engaging in was that 
of the manufacture of barrel hoops in Pennsylvania, where he continued ac- 
tively engaged for six years in Blair county. He did an extensive business, 
including the operating of a large general store, and employed from twenty- 
five to thirty men. His health failed him and he moved to Philadelphia, and 
there engaged in the shoe business, removing, however, to \\'illiamstown, 
Xew Jersey, in 1865, at the close of the civil war. Here he engaged in work 
and business more suitable to. his liking, those of lumberman and farmer, in 
a moderate manner. By his good business tact and frugal ways, he amassed 
a handsome property. He was a self-made man. accumulating what he pos- 
sessed by his own industry and toil and his good management. It should 
be here stated that his father was the first man to make, sell and ship the 
smooth-shaved hogshead hoops used formerly in great quantities in the 
sugar districts of the West Indies. Previously all hoops were shipped in the 
rough, as cut from hickory and other saplings. It was Lawrence Souder 
who first shipped this line of goods to the sugar planters of Cuba and other 
West India islands. Our subject succeeded him in this business and also 
added the manufacture and exporting of "shook." 

J. D. Souder was a member and strong friend of the Methodist Episcopal 
church, and lived an exemplary life in his daily walks with his fellow men. 
He never aspired to office, but it is related that he at one time held local 
positions, such as township trustee and treasurer, to the full satisfaction of 
his townsmen. 

Like most other well balanced and sensible men. our subject lielieved in 
the sanctity of the true home and family life. Hence it was that on 
May 3, 1857, he was united in marriage to Martha E. Kirby, the daughter 
of Mr. and Mrs. William Kirby, of Philadelphia. Her grandfather was a 
soldier in the war of 1812; the family is one of more than ordinary promi- 
nence. Tliis marriage resulted in the birth of six children, four of whom are 
now living: William L.. C. Oscar, living on the homestead at Williamstown: 
Martha Virginia, the wife of Dr. H. A. Jelly, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, and 
Anna C, the wdfe of Henry Glo\er. of Rochester. New York. 

This notice but gives a faint outline of a noble life, but mav serve well 
as a written monument to the memory of a man whose everv act was fraught 
with some good thought or deed worthv of emulation. To those who mav

JOHN H. GROFF, M. D. 

For a quarter of a century Dr. John H. Groff has been actively engaged 
in the practice of medicine and surgery at Penn Grove, Salem county, 
and seven years at Sharptown; and among those of his profession and in the 
estimation of the general public no one stands higher in this section of the 
state. 

The birth of Dr. Groff occurred three-score years ago, in this county: 
and in early life he applied himself to the tasks necessary to be performed 
upon a farm. He continued to assist his father until more than a year had 
elapsed since he had come to legal age, when he determined to enter a 
profession. His father, Charles F. Groff, was a native of Lower Alloway 
Creek, Salem county, and was reared there to the age of maturity. Early 
in life he learned the tailor's trade, but eventually — preferring the free, 
independent, out-door existence of an agriculturist — he became a farmer. 
He was a quiet, unassuming man and a faithful memlier of the Baptist 
church. He was summoned to his reward in 1879, when he was seventy-nine 
years of age. His wife, whose name in girlhood had been Harriet Hum- 
phreys, lived to be sixty-three years of age, and of their four children — John 
H., Mary R., Anna and Keziah — the last mentioned only is deceased. 

As stated previously, Dr. John H. Groff concluded that he would not 
follow his father's calling as a life work, and accordingly, in the beginning of 
the year 1861, he entered the office of Dr. Clawson, of ^^'oodstown, New 
Jersey, and commenced the study of medicine. But the clouds of civil 
war, gathering fast, gradually encroached upon the young man's attention. 
Thus he was one of the iirst to respond to his country's call for loyal men 
and true to protect the Union, and in April, 1861, his name was enrolled 
as a private in Company I, Captain Sinnickson. Fourth New Jersey Regi- 
ment, which went to the front from Trenton. The company to which the 
Doctor belonged was stationed on picket duty around Washington, D. C. 
until the time of its enlistment was out. 

Returning home, our subject then dexoted himself assiduously to his 
studies until the extremely serious position of the government again made 
itself strongly felt in the minds of all. He re-enlisted for a term of three 
years, as a member of Company H, Twelfth Regiment of New Jersey 
Infantrv, and continued in the ser\ice until the close of the war. During

the important battle of Chancellorsville he was wounded m the left forearm 
bv the bursting of a shell, and, as a result of that and the necessary operation 
following, the arm was rendered almost a useless member. \\ hen he had 
recovered sufficiently to permit of his being placed on duty, he was trans- 
ferred to the Veterans' Reserve Corps and sent to Baltmiore for duty m 
hospital. During 'his term of sei-^-ice there the surgeon m charge of the 
hospital kindly gave him his time and permission to pursue his studies, 
which he did for about a vear. under the direction of Dr. J. H. Butler, an 
assistant surgeon of the hospital and a demonstrator of anatomy in the 
University of Marvland. In this institution he took his first-year course of 
lectures The war ended soon after and he was discharged from the ser- 
vice After a short visit home in Woodstown, New Jersey, he returned to 
Baltimore, finished his studies with Dr. Butler and graduated at the V'm- 
versitv there in March, 1866. 

A few weeks later he opened an office at Sharptown, Salem county. 

and' began the practice of his loved profession. He resided there seven 

years, and in December of 1873 removed to Penn Grove, Salem county. 

where he has enjoyed a large and lucrative practice. , ■ , , 

In 1868 Dr. GrofT married Olivia J. King, of Baltimore, who is a lady 

of excellent education and attainments. Her parents were Livingston and 

Elizabeth (Dimmet) King, the former of whom is deceased Dr. Groff. 

who is quiet and reserved in manner, is very highly esteemed by those who 

know him well, and is a member of the Masonic order. 

J. DOWN HERITAGE, M. D. 
Dr T Down Heritage, a prominent physician and surgeon of Glassboro. 
New Jersey, was born September 14, 1837, in Hurffville, Washington town- 
ship Gloucester county. New Jersey, and his paternal ancestor, Thomas J. 
Heritage, was also a native of the same place, as well as our subject s grand- 
father, Josiah Heritage, and his great-grandfather, Benjamin Heritage, 
whose father, Richard, was one of the original proprietors of Burlington, 
New Jersev The familv still possess the old deeds of the land upon which 
now stands the citv. The first American ancestors, of the Quaker faith, 
came from England about 1600. Returning to our subject's father, Thomas 
J it may be said that he was a Methodist in his religious faith and that he 
served as a church trustee for many years. He was married to Charity, a 
dauo-hter of John Down, of Bethel, now Hurffville. Their children were J. 
Down Heritage, our subject. Amy and Arthur. Amy married Isaac Steven- 
son. The mother died in 1846, and the father in 1883. 



142 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Dr. Heritage, our subject, after obtaining a good common-school edu- 
cation, attended school at Pennington Seminary for three years, after which 
he taught for two years. He graduated at the University of Pennsylvania in 
1862, and was soon commissioned an assistant surgeon in the army. After 
practicing six months, he joined the Eleventh New Jersey Volunteers, which 
regiment was a part of the Army of the Potomac. He was with the Eleventh 
for three years, sen'ing in that illustrious army during all the battles, marches 
and campaigns in which it took part in the rebellion. He was taken prisoner 
of war at Ream's Station, Virginia, and held in Libby prison for one month, 
after which he was released. At the close of the war. Dr. Heritage came 
hom,e and began to practice medicine at his home town and after one year 
he came to Glassboro. He belongs to the Masonic order and at one time 
was quite prominent in the Knights of Pythias and Red Men's orders. He 
was elected to the ofifice of grand chancellor of the Knights of Pythias of 
the state of New Jersey, serving in 1893. He was the supreme representa- 
tive in 1875-6. In keeping with the good sense of every man, our subject 
was married May 26, 1869, to Elizabeth, the daughter of Charles Shivers, of 
Swedesboro. Three children have come to brighten their home: Dr. Charles 
S., at home: Christian S., assistant superintendent of the Pennsylvania Rail- 
road, at Alount Holly; and Sarah A., at home. 

Our subject is not now in active practice, having retired and given the 
work over to his son, Dr. Charles S. Heritage. When he was in practice he 
was accounted one of the best surgeons in his part of the state. It was he 
who prepared the article on the geology of southern New Jersey, for a late 
history of Gloucester, Salem and Cumberland counties. But the medical 
work will not suffer, because his son is a learned man, both in letters and 
sciences, and a skillful practitioner and surgeon. He attended and gradu- 
ated at Pennington and the University of Pennsylvania, in the class of 1893.

Albert Isl. Seabrook, the able editor and proprietor of the Glassboro 
Enterprise, is a native of Dutchess county. New York, born near Rhinebeck. 
April I, 1 86 1. Of his family connection it may be said that his father was 
Samuel S. Seabrook, a native of England, and his grandfather was an Epis- 
copal clergyman, who prepared young men for the colleges of higher learn- 
ing. Samuel S. Seabrook came to the United States about 1859 and located 
near Rhinebeck. New York, -where he had charge of a large dairy farm.

died in Deerfield, Cuml^erland county. New Jersey, in 1871. His wife's 
maiden name was Fanny Peaters. She is still living, at the age of sixty-five 
years. By their union four children were born: Arthur P., of Deerfield, New 
Jersey; Frank, of Centerton; our subject, and Edwin, of Camden. 

After leaving the common schools of his county our subject, in 1885, 
graduated at the Trenton State Normal school and followed teaching for 
six years, at Gibbstown, New Jersey, and at Monroeville, the same state. 
Having an ambition to enter the journalistic field, in 1891, he purchased 
the Glassboro Enterprise, which he still ably conducts. In 1898 he was 
elected a justice of the peace, which place he still fills, with credit to himself 
and to those who have business with him. He is an active member of the 
rvlethodist church and a Sabbath-school worker. He is one of the church 
stewards and the president of the Epworth League; also the first vice-presi- 
dent of the Bridgeton District League. In fraternal matters he is connected 
with the Junior Order of United American Mechanics and the Daughters of 
Liberty. 

June 20, 1888, he was united in marriage to Mary D., the daughter of 
John Johnson and wife, of Gibbstown, New Jersey. One child, Byron M., 
came to bless their home circle. IMr. Seabrook is an enterprising, well in- 
formed gentleman, whose aim in the newspaper field is to give the patrons 
of his paper the latest news in his part of the state. Nothing but clean, sen- 
sible editorials ever come from his journalistic pen. 



C. L. DUFFELL, M. D. 

Dr. C. L. Duffell, a leading physician and surgeon of Clayton, New Jer- 
sey, is a native of Camden, of the same state. His great-grandfather came 
from Holland to this country and settled in Cumberland county, New Jer- 
sey, and became a glass-manufacturer, — among the first in the country. 
David Duffell, the father of our subject, was also born in Camden, was a 
merchant in that town, and about 1838 was admitted into the New Jersey 
conference as a ^Methodist minister. He served the church faithfully many 
years, and died in Clayton in 1S84. He married into the Hawley family, of 
Connecticut. 

Our subject. Dr. Duffell, attended the common schools and also Penning- 
ton Seminary, graduated at Jeft'erson College, in 1862, and immediately after 
leaving college he joined the Fifty-first Pennsylvania regiment as assistant 
surgeon and served his country for three years, seeing much hard and active 
service. He was with Pope in Virginia; was in Tennessee, and with General

Grant, at Vicksburg, as well as in the Potomac campaigns. No soldier saw 
more of that terrible civil conflict than did this man of whom we now write. 
After peace had been established he returned and took up his practice at Wil- 
liamstown, New Jersey. Five years afterward he went into the Bodine glass- 
works; but in 1878 he resumed the practice of medicine, at Clayton, where 
he has been very successful in all branches, especially in surgery and obstet- 
rics. He has been on the board of education for years and is now the presi- 
dent, having served for fifteen years. He is the medical inspector for the 
board of health. In religious matters he is an active Methodist and holds 
many oiificial places, being widely known. 

In 1866 the Doctor married Phoebe, a daughter of John F. Bodine. of 
Williamstown. They were of an old family, in this section. Her grandfather 
started the glass-works at Williamstown, many years ago. Mr. and Mrs. 
Duffell are the parents of two children: one is deceased and the other is 
married to W. S. Sinickson, who is a clothing dealer in Salem, New Jersey, 
and one of the most active business men. 

The community in which our subject lives and practices the healing art 
very much prizes him. Besides being a skillful physician, he is an influential 
and honored member of society. The service he rendered his country, when 
in peril of war, will never be forgotten. 



URIAH GILMAN, M. D. 

A prominent physician and surgeon of Woodstown, Dr. Uriah Gilman 
is a patriot, having served his country well in times of peace and during the 
troublous days of war. He stands high in his chosen profession, which he 
has followed in this town for more than three decades, and many of the best 
families of this vicinity are numbered among his patrons. 

The eldest of the seven children of Richard F. S. and Ann (Taylor) Gil- 
man, the Doctor was born September 11, 1838, in Upper Penn's Neck town- 
ship, Salem county. His father, whose birth occurred in Roadstone, Cum- 
berland county, New Jersey, April 25. 1812, was a farmer by occupation, 
though in his early manhood he learned the trade of watch-maker with the 
intention of following that vocation. He managed a valuable homestead 
situated in Upper Pittsgrove township, and, in addition to raising a general 
line of crops common to this region, he dealt extensively in livestock and 
met with a fair degree of success in his various business transactions. Al- 
though his educational advantages had been limited to those afforded by the 
district schools, he possessed sound, practical common-sense, and w'as con- 



CONGRESSIOiXAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 145 

sidered to be a man of exceptional intelligence. Religiously he was a Baptist 
and had deeply at heart the upbuilding and progress of the church. Death 
called him to his reward on New Year's day, 1897, and in the following sum- 
mer, in Jtily, his devoted wife also entered the silent land. She was a daugh- 
ter of Damon and Mary Ann (Smith) Taylor, of Pittsgroxe township, Salem 
county. The father, who was a farmer, took a leading part in the building 
of the Baptist church at Woodstown, in the early part of the century, and 
though he was a young man, with his own way to make in the world, and 
with a family to rear and provide for, he contributed fifty dollars in cash 
and more than that amount besides, in work on the structure. He was only 
forty years of age at the time of his death, yet he had accomplished more 
for the lasting good of his community than many of his neighbors much 
older than he had done. He reared two sons, J'ohn, and David, who was 
engaged in the practice of medicine in Arkansas, and eventually died in Cali- 
fornia. On the paternal side of the family, our subject had five uncles and 
one aunt, namely: Stratton, Abram, Benjamin. Lemuel, Ephraim and Eliza- 
beth, all of whom are deceased. His own brothers and sisters are: Damon 
Taylor, Richard S., John Taylor, Stratton, and Mary A., who married Joseph 
R. Humphreys. All of the number are deceased. Damon T., who was 
wounded at the battle of Morton's Ford and the Wilderness. Virginia, was 
a member of Company A, Twelfth Xew Jersey \'olunteers, during the war of 
the Rebellion. 

After completing his district-school studies Dr. Oilman attended the 
Woodstown and Bridgeton schools for a period, after which he pursued a 
three-year course at the West Jersey Academy. Then going to Arkansas, 
he read medicine with his uncle, David Taylor, of Rocky Comfort, Little 
River county. With this foundation, he returned to the east, and matriculated 
as a southern student at the Jefferson Medical College, of Philadelphia, where 
he was graduated with a degree, in 1861. The great civil-war issue was at 
hand, and, while he was on his way to the w-est once more, he found at 
Cincinnati that the postal lines were practically closed between the north 
and the south, and he retraced his steps to his old Xew Jersey home. 
Learning that Dr. John Wiley, of Cape May Court House, had entered the 
Union service as the surgeon of the Sixth Regiment of this state, he took 
up his practice, which he carried on successfully for about a year. Then, 
resisting no longer his earnest desire to do all in his power for his stricken 
country, he enlisted with the Twelfth Regimental stafT as surgeon, and con- 
tinued to act in that capacity until the close of the war. He was at the 
post of duty during the fierce battles of Chancellorsville, Cold Harbor, 
Petersburg, Deep Bottom, Gettysburg, Auburn and Bristoe Station, Mor-

and Boydton plank road. He also spent six weeks in the Seminary Hos- 
pital, Georgetown, D. C. The date of his enlistment was August 20, 1862. 
and his honorable discharge was granted June 5, 1865. Soon after he left 
the army the Doctor entered the revenue ser\'ice and for one year was 
detailed on duty on board the revenue cruiser "Lincoln," at the end of 
which time he returned to this state, via the Nicaragua route. He located 
in Woodstown in 1867, since which year he has been regularly engaged in 
practice. His love for the "boys who wore the blue" has never waned, and 
for years he was very active in the Grand Army organization, being the 
commander of the John G. Fortin Post, No. 57, during the last years of 
its existence. 

In social circles of this place and elsewhere, he is deservedly popular, 
as is also his estimable wife. A marriage ceremony celebrated Feliruary 
4, 1869, united the destinies of Dr. Gilman and Miss Keziah Richman, a 
daughter of Abram and Clarissa (Dubois) Richman. The father was a 
well-to-do farmer of Richman's Mills, owning valuable property and mills in 
that locality. The Doctor and wife are members of the Presbyterian church 
of Woodstown, and take an influential part in all local philanthropic work. 



JOHN WOOLSON REEVES. 

This gentleman, who is now ably and faithfully serving as the sheriff of 
Cape jVIay county and makes his home at Cape May Court House, is a rep- 
resentative of one of the old and prominent families of this locality. Prior 
to the war of the Revolution there came to Cape May county from Cumber- 
land county, New Jersey, three brothers, — Adonijah, Abraham and Aliijah 
Reeves. Tlie first named was three times married and though he had se\eral 
children none of his descendants are now living. 

Abijah Reeves, the third brother, was born in Cumberland county. New 
Jersey, in the year 1750, and came to Cape May county in 1772. In his 
fiftieth year he married Miss Mercy Hand, who was twenty-seven years of 
age and a resident of Cape May county. They had four sons and two daugh- 
ters, namely: Abraham, David, Andrew H., Joshua H., Sarah and Mercy: 
but the last named died in infancy. The youngest son was the father 
of our subject. Abijah Reeves was a soldier in the Revolutionarv 
war and was a member of Captain Joshua Townsend's company of 
militia in the war of 18 12. This company consisted of brave and hardy men.

inured to toil and fearless of danger, and to them Cajie May count\' will 
ever owe a debt of gratitude for the ser\'ice they rendered. Abijah Reeves 
died in the year 1822, at the age of seventy-two years, and his wife passed 
away in 1847, at the age of seventy-four years. Their remains were interred 
in the Cold Spring cemetery. 

Joshua H. Reeves, the fourth son of Abijah and Mercy (Hand) Reeves, 
was bom in Lower township. Cape May county. July 22, i8o8, and at an 
early age was apprenticed to Isaac Whildin to learn the shoemaker's trade. 
He completed his apprenticeship, but the business did not agree with his 
health and accordingly he entered the employ of a neighboring farmer. 
Enoch Edmunds, who ]iro\ed to him a most faithful friend. Joshua H. 
Reeves was a man of the highest character, strictest integrity and honoralile 
in all his dealings. He was a kind father, but firm in family discipline. Always 
a model in his personal appearance, carefully exacting in dress and toilet, he 
thus exemplified the maxim that cleanliness is next to Godliness. At the 
age of thirty-two Mr. Reeves became a member of the Cold Spring Presby- 
terian church and was up to the time of his death one of its most consistent 
attendants. He was a strong advocate of the temperance cause, being the 
president of the Order of Sons of Temperance. The great destroving in- 
fluences of drink were just then beginning to fasten themselves upon the 
public with conclusive conviction and he was one of the first to take an active 
step in the solving of one of the greatest social problems that confronts our 
government. He was one of the original founders of the Cape Sundav- 
school and for many years labored in its interests. At the time of his death 
he was serving as its superintendent. 

On January i, 1833, Joshua H. Reeves was married to Eleanor W'oolson, 
and to them were born seven sons and four daughters, as follows: David, 
born October 15, 1833; Swain S., born July 17, 1836: Andrew H., bom 
May 26, 1838; John W., born December 31. 1840; Charles W.. born Janu- 
ary II. 1843: Joshua H., Jr., born December i. 1844: Mary E., born Janu- 
arv 26, 1847; George H.. born January 29. 1849; Ann E.. born December 
22. 1850; Eliza W.. born July 30, 1852: and Annie M., born September 
19, 1854. The father of these children died November 26, 1855, aged 
forty-seven, and the mother August 31, 1898, at the ripe age of eightv-five 
years. 

John Woolson Reeves, the fourth son of Joshua and Eleanor Reeves, 
the well known sheriff of Cape May county, is the subject of our sketch. 
Mr. Reeves is a native of Lower township and has resided within the county 
all his life. Adverse circumstances early forced him to depend upon him- 
self, as his father suffered a stroke of paralysis, from which he never recov-

ered. when our subject was only thirteen years old, and he was obliged to 
leave school in order to provide for his mother, younger brothers and sisters. 
Consequently his educational privileges were very limited. His first em- 
ployment was that of a farm hand when fourteen years of age, in which 
capacity he served until he reached his majority. As compensation for 
his services for the first few years he received only board and clothing, but 
later earned a salary of six to nine tlollars per month. While assisting in 
the support of his mother and younger children of the family, the Civil war 
broke out, and responding to his country's call he enlisted in Company F, 
Twenty-fifth Regiment, New Jersey Volunteers, August 23, 1862. He was 
mustered in at Beverly, this state, on the first of September and served 
under the command of Captain David Blenkow and Colonel Andrew Dur- 
ham, his company being composed of a hundred men from Cape May 
county. They joined the Army of the Potomac under General Burnside, 
but soon after this Mr. Reeves was stricken with scarlet fever and sent to 
Fairfax Hospital, subsequently being transferred to the Philadeljihia Hos- 
pital. 

After returning from the war Mr. Reeves engaged in farming upon the 
old homestead in connection with several other business interests. He 
was associated in the building and owning of a number of vessels for coast 
trading purposes and was extensively engaged in the shipping of gravel to 
Philadelphia and other ports. The gravel business at that time was a big 
industry. He also bought considerable real estate and erected a number 
of residences. 

From the time Mr. Reeves cast his first ballot up to the present he has 
taken a lively interest in politics and has served his county in many and 
various positions of trust. Like all the other members of the family he is 
and always has been a stanch supporter of the principles of the Republican 
party. He has lieen the township committeeman for Lower township, 
was a member of the board of chosen freeholders for ten years, acting as 
the director of that body during the last five, during which time the county 
almshouse was erected, at a cost of seventeen thousand dollars, and has 
served as a member of the county board of elections, whose duty is to 
examine and appoint all election boards, and for three years was its chair- 
man. He has also served in several other minor official capacities. 

Mr. Reeves has been tendered the nomination for county clerk and for 
both branches of the legislature, but all have been declined. In November, 
1898. he was elected the sheriff of Cape May county, his opponent being 
Stilwell H. Townsend. He did not seek the office and was only induced to 
accept the nomination after repeated solicitations. Elected by a good ma- 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEiV JERSEY. 149 

jority, he is now serving in that position, faithfnlly performing his duties, 
for no trust reposed in him has ever been l:ietrayed in the slightest degree. 
He has ahvavs labored earnestly to promote the growth and insure the 
success of his party, has been a delegate to various conventions and for 
three years was the chairman of the Republican county conventions. His 
political course has ever been most honorable and has commanded the 
respect of those of opposite political faith. Mr. Reeves' business interests 
have been varied and quite successful. He is progressive, energetic and 
practical, — qualities which, when directed by good business judgment, never 
fail to bring success. What he undertakes he carries forward to successful 
completion and through legitimate channels of trade has accumulated a well 
merited competence. Mr. Reeves is a member and director of the Cape 
May Saving Fund Building & Loan Association, the Mechanics & Laborers' 
Building & Loan Association, a director of the Cape May Agricultural Asso- 
ciation and a member of the Ancient Order of LTnited \\'orkmen and the 
John Mecray Post, No. 40. G. A. R. 

Mr. Reeves was reared in the Presbyterian faith, being a pewdiolder 
of the old brick church at Cold Spring, where he has attended all his life. 
The cause of education and temperance finds in him a strong advocate and 
he withholds his support from no movement or measure which is calcu- 
lated to promote the welfare of the community along material, intellectual, 
social and moral lines. 

On the 3d of March. 1869. Mr. Reeves married Miss Emma L., a daugh- 
ter of John X. Xott. who was of English birth and education and who 
became a school-teacher in Lower township. Cape May county. Four 
sons have been born of this union: Andrew Higgins. the eldest, is en- 
gaged in the drug business at Tuckerton. N. J. He received his education 
at the West Cape May Academy and later attended the Philadelphia College 
of Pharmacy in Philadelphia. David LeRoy. the second son, is a practicing 
attorney at the bar of Philadelphia. He prepared for college at South 
Jersey Institute, Bridgeton, New Jersey, and subsequently entered Lafay- 
ette College at Easton, Pennsylvania. He read law in the office of the 
firm of Gendell & Reeves, attending the L^niversity of Pennsylvania Law 
School at the same time. He was admitted to the bar in 1897 and has 
offices with his preceptors in the Crozer Building. 1420 Chestnut street, 
Philadelphia. 

He married Katherine Cornell Tallman and two children have been born 
to them. — John Woolson and Howard Gendell. Abram Carl, the third son, 
is still a student. Having an unusually strong artistic instinct, he is pre- 
paring hin:self for a life work in art and is now pursuing his third year in

EUGENE WAA'. M. D. 



The name of this gentleman is inscribed high on the roll of New Jersey's 
eminent medical practitioners, and his standing in the profession is shown 
b}- the fact that he is now accorded the largest practice given to any physi- 
cian of Ca]ie May count}-. For more than twenty years he has given to 
his duties as a representative of the calling his close and undivided atten- 
tion, and he is remarkably skillful in the exercise of important functions 
which are demanded by the healing art. Added to his natural ability was 
his careful preparation for tiie work, and he has never yet ceased to be an 
earnest and diligent student of the science of medicine. Thus has he gained 
prestige and prosperity, and in the history of his adopted county he well 
deserves honorable mention. 

The Doctor was born in Kirkwood. Broome county. New York. Sep- 
temljer 14. 1857. and is a son of Dr. Palmer M. and Ann Amelia (Wilson) 
Wa}-. He pursued his literary education in the i)ublic schools of the Empire 
state and in Cajie May count}-, and after determining to devote his attention 
to the medical profession he entered the JeiTerson Medical College, of 
Philadelphia, in which he was graduated March 12, 1879, on the completion of 
a three-year course. Thus prepared for the practice of medicine, he opened 
an office in South Seaville. Cape May county, where he remained for three 
years, when in 1882 he came to Dennisville. where he has since made his 
home. From the l^eginning his practice has steadily and constantly increased 
until it has now assumed extensive proportions, bringing him a reputation 
secoml to none in the county. He is well versed in all departments of the 
science of medicine, and has also taken a course in pharmacy, receiving 
from the state board a diploma. He has been for two years a member of 
the pension board at Bridgeton and devotes one day each week to his work 
in that connection, being associated on the board with Dr. S. M. Wilson, of 
Bridgeton. and Dr. M. .\. Foulkener. of Vineiand. Their district comprises 
the greater part of the congressional district. The Doctor is a frequent and 
valued contributor to a number of the leading medical journals and is a mem- 
ber of the Cape May County Medical Society, the New Jersey State Medical 
Society, and the American Medical Association. He is a member of the 
board of health of Dennisville and has been a health inspector for ten years. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 151 

On the 17th of March, 1880, Dr. Way was united in marriage to Miss 
Mary Adams, a daughter of ex-Sherifif Albert Adams, of South Seaville. 
Four children were born to them: Clarence, a student in the Peddy Institute, 
in Heightstown, New Jersey; and Jessie, Fannie and Sara, at home. Tlie 
Doctor is connected with some civic societies, being a member of the 
Knights of Pythias fraternity, at Dennisville, and of the Independent Order 
of Odd Fellows, at Cape May Court House. He has long been a faithful 
member of the Baptist church, in which he has held all the offices, including 
those of deacon, trustee and church clerk. He has written a history of the 
church, a work of thirty pages, giving an account of its progress and work 
through one hundred and seventy years. He is a man of broad humani- 
tarian principles and deep sympathy, and his spirit of helpfulness is often 
manifested, but always unostentatiouslv. 



A. B. WOODRUFF. M. D. 

Dr. A. B. Woodruff, of Elmer, Salem county. New Jersey, has been a 
practicing physician of this county for more than twenty years and is the 
leading practitioner in this section, occupying a place second to none in the 
affections of the people. He was born at Bridgeton. Cumberland county, 
this state, June 13, 1850, in the spot where his father was born and about 
two miles from the birthplace of his grandfather. He is a son of Isaac D. 
Woodruff, who was born in this county in 1825. He was a resident of 
Hopewell township. They were a family of farmers, the son Isaac D., the 
father of Mr. Woodruff', following the same occupation and accumulating 
a moderate fortune. He was a pleasant, easy-tempered man who made 
many friends, and his upright, honorable conduct won universal respect. He 
united with the Presbyterian church and strove to regulate his every-day 
life according to its precepts. He married Miss Hannah Brooks, of Green- 
wich, Cumberland county, a daughter of Alpheus Brooks. She is now in her 
seventieth year and became the mother of five children, three of whom are 
still living. They are Dr. A. B.; Ella, Mrs. Frank Tice: and Hannah, Mrs. 
Harvey Havens, both sisters residing in the vicinity of Bridgeton. The 
father passed gently away in October, 1889, just as nature was donning her 
autumnal garb preparatory to taking her winter's rest. 

Dr. Woodruff attended the common schools and West Jersey Academy, 
at Bridgeton. He then secured a position in Whipple's drug store, where 
he remained three years and there received the nucleus of that education in 
which he afterward perfected himself by a course in the University of Penn- 
sylvania, located at Philadelphia. In 1874 he had completed the four-years 



152 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

course, and graduated at the institution with the degree of M. D., when he 
at once returned to his native town and began the practice of his chosen 
profession. He remained there three years and was meeting with success, 
but decided a better scope was offered for his work in some other locality, 
and accordingly moved his office to Elmer, where he has continued since 
1877 and worked his way up from a humble beginning to one of the largest 
and most lucrative practices in the county. His area of patronage is not 
confined to this particular locality, but has extended over a wide range of 
country, where his reputation had preceded him. He travels over long dis- 
tances to care for his cases and it requires three horses to carry him over 
his rounds. He has been most careful in his diagnosis of disease and 
skillful in his treatment, meeting with the happiest results, winning words of 
commendation and praise from even those who do not agree with his 
methods. He is a genial, "cheery," kind-hearted, sympathetic man, whose 
very presence in the sick-room inspires the afflicted with courage and hope, 
and many an unfortunate poor family has reason to bless his ministrations, 
as well as the family of wealth. He is a general practitioner and keeps 
well up with the times on all the latest and most approved discoveries in the 
science of medicine, applying this knowledge whenever it seems desirable 
to do so. .While a very busy man, the Doctor is deeply interested in all 
local affairs and is ready to assist in any way in his power the promotion of 
municipal growth and prosperity. He is a member of the different metlical 
societies and of the board of trade. 

October 14, 1874, he married Miss Anna, a daughter of Charles Ashcroft, 
who was a sea captain; and their four children are Gertrude, .\lice, Charles 
and Isaac . 



GEORGE H. WAINWRIGHT. 

George Hanson Wainwright, a designer of merit who is well known to 
all large carpet houses, is a native of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, Eng- 
land, his natal day being February 26, 1852. His parents were James and 
Clara (Hanson) Wainwright. natives of Tamworth and Birmingham respec- 
tively. The paternal grandfather was a resident of Tamworth, Stafford- 
shire, England, and was noted as a man of great strength and endurance. 
He lived to reach an extreme age and retained the use of all his faculties 
in their vigor until the last. He was reared in the Episcopal faith and was 
an earnest Christian. He married a Miss Blood, a relative of Thomas Guy, 
who founded Guy's Hospital and College in London, and built and en- 
dowed the almshouses at Tamworth, his mother's native place. He pros-

pered in his business and left a handsome legacy to be distributed among 
those who could prove any relationship to him, he himself being a bachelor. 
(See The Condensed American Cyclopedia, Vol. II, — Cuba-Jarrow, — page 
524; and The World-wide Cyclopedia, Vol. VII, page 2985, — published 
by the Bible House, New York.) 

James Wainwright was born at Tamworth, England, in 1809, and was 
educated at the college located there. He was an industrious lad and at an 
early age took charge of a carpet-manufacturing plant. Later he engaged 
in the mercantile business, continuing it until his death at Kidderminster, 
October 19. 1864, when he was in the prime of life, fifty-five years of age. 
He was also reared in the Episcopal church, but later united with the Con- 
gregational church and took an active part in their meetings, was super- 
intendent of the Sunday-school, etc. He was a man who was much loved 
and esteemed and aimed to govern his life by the Golden Rule. He mar- 
ried Miss Clara Hanson and twelve children were born to them, viz.: Sarah; 
Andrew; Edward; Clara; Elizabeth; James; William, who came to America 
and was foreman in a woolen mill at Lowell, Massachusetts; Eliza; George 
H., our subject; John; and two that died in infancy. The wife and mother 
died June 11, 1869, at the age of fifty-eight years. 

George Hanson W'ainwright received his educational training in the 
public schools of Kidderminster and at an early age developed a wonderful 
talent for drawing. He showed such marked ability as an artist that it was 
deemed advisable to give him the benefit of the best instructors, and he 
entered the School of Design at Kidderminster, where he applied himself 
diligently and carried off the prize over the other pupils. Soon after com- 
pleting his studies he engaged with a manufacturer of carpets to get a fuller 
knowledge of the application of design to the fabric, by being where they 
were made. His skill as a designer having become the public talk, he was 
importuned to accept positions with different large manufacturing plants, 
who realized the value that his work would be to them. He finally closed 
with a good offer from a carpet-manufacturer and remained with him a few 
years, at the same time attending the School of Design to still further per- 
fect himself. He was still quite young and had been two years an assistant 
in a factory before he was seventeen. Coming to America, he accepted a 
position as a designer for the Hartford Carpet Company, of New York city, 
and later for Joseph Barrett, of the same place. He was employed by 
Alexander Smith & Sons' Carpet Company, of Yonkers, New York, and 
the Lowell Carpet Company, of Lowell, Massachusetts, and after that 
worked at designing for himself, making patterns for carpets, oil-cloths, 
curtains, etc., and selling" them direct to manufacturers. His designs always 



154 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

met with ready sale, and he is one of the best artists in this Hne in tliis 
country, and his ideas are always original and take the popular fanc}-. He 
has been able to lay up a neat sum by his industry and has a fine farm of 
one hundred and fifty and one-half acres in Ouinton township, this county, 
besides being one of the stockholders in the City National Bank. He 
is a man of great popularity among his neighbors, and of straightforward, 
honest character that calls for the hearty commendation of all who have 
dealings with him. 

Mr. Wainwright was married Feliruary 12, 1894, to ^Nliss Sarah Shep- 
pard Walker, whose father, William Sheppard Walker, was a farmer of 
Upper Alloway's Creek township, well known as a strong advocate of 
temperance and one of the best friends of the anti-slavery cause during 
the early history of the county. He was a son of \\'illiam. one of the 
founders of the Alloway Baptist church, and a grandson of Robert Walker, 
who was one of three brothers who came to America at an early day and 
located in Alloway, now OuintOH township, on a large farm of one thousand 
acres. His son William was also a farmer in that township and reared his 
children there. He was thrice married, his first wife, Sarah Sheppard. bore 
him three children,- — Sarah, Phoebe and William Sheppard Walker, the 
father of Mrs. Wainwright. He died at the age of se\enty-two years, and 
she at the age of twenty-nine, and buried in Salem churchyard, near where 
her brother, Joseph Sheppard, preached and taught for twenty years. The 
father of Mrs. ^^'ainwright was Ijorn in 1806, in Alloway township, and 
became one of the most substantial agriculturists of the county. He was 
a member of the Baptist church, known far and wide for his Christian prin- 
ciples and the rigid maimer in which he exemplified his faith. He was un- 
compromising in his utterances on the slavery question and neglected no 
opportunity to aid the unfortunate. He was also one of the strongest 
exponents of the principles of temperance. 

His first wife was Ann Hewitt, who left him four children at her death, 
namely: William, David, Joseph and Thomas, the two oldest reaching 
manhood. David was in the civil war and fought for his country at Chan- 
cellorsville and Fredericksburg. The second wife was Ann Stow, the mother 
of Charles, Thomas, Sarah (the wife of our subject), Anna and Emma 
Walker. Their father died in 1864, at the age of fifty-eight years, and their 
mother in September. 1881, when she was seventy-four years old. Thomas 
Stow W'alker was a minister of the Baptist faith and the first to be licensed 
to preach by the Memorial church, in Salem, to which city they remo\-ed 
from Alloway. 

Mrs. Wainwright is a womanlv woman who has unusual charm of manner 



COXGRESS/OXJL DISTRICT OF XEIi' JERSEY. 155 

and a decided literary talent. She is a graduate of the New Jersey State 
Normal School, of the class of 1864. and was a teacher for twelve years, 
seven of them heing spent in the school-rooms in Salem, where she was 
one of the most successful teachers employed. In 1883 she entered the 
Woman's Baptist Home Mission Training School, then located on Michi- 
gan avenue in Chicago, remaining for six months. Afterward she was sent 
to inspect and report upon the work of its missionaries in Jacksonville, Flor- 
ida. Later she visited England and spent two months in Mildmay Park, 
London, and haunts of Cowper and Carey, marrying after her return to this 
country. It is her delight to refer to her former pupils, now filling offices 
of trust, as mayor of the city, county clerk, surrogate, positions in the 
banks of the city, teachers in schools, etc. In May, 1899, it was the privilege 
of herself and hus1)and to cross the continent of North America with three 
hundred Baptists to attend a convention in San Francisco, California. 

Mrs. Wainwright is a writer of exquisite pathos and fine humor, and 
her verses are worthy a place in any library. To a young friend, who in 
1882 wrote a letter to her, saying, "To-morrow is my birthday." she com- 
posed the following in reply:

And reaching to our fellow man 
We tread the paths of love. 



CHARLES B. CORSON, M. D. 

Dr. Charles B. Corson, who is successfully engaged in the practice of 
medicine in South Seaville, was born in the town which is still his home. 
August 8, 1869, his parents being Remington and Mary P. (York) Corson. 
The original spelling of the name was Carsten. but with the passing of the 
years the present orthography has been adopted. The great grandfather of 
the Doctor was Remington Corson, Sr., and his father, Lewis Corson, resided 
at Beesley's Point and had four sons,- — Remington. Lewis, Frank and Still- 
well. The first named was a farmer by occupation and at the time of his 
death, which occurred in 1828, when he was forty years of age, he was carry- 
ing on agricultural pursuits at Cold Spring, Cape May county. He married 
Priscilla Townsend, and they had four children; Baker; Uriah, seafaring 
men; Edith, wife of William Godfrev, and Henrv T. The last named was 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEir JERSEY. 157 

born March 17, 1828, has always followed the sea. and in the civil war he 
served in the naval department, carrying supplies for the government. He 
married Priscilla L. Corson, and they had a son. Richard Somers. a seafaring 
man, who was killed by a falling elevator in Boston. After the death of his 
first wife, Henry T. Corson wedded Hannah T. Learning. 

Baker Corson, the grandfather, was born in Cape May county, in 1815. 
and was a sea captain on a coasting schooner throughout his business career. 
He also engaged in general merchandising in South Seaville, and was resid- 
ing near the town at the time of his demise. The Republican party received 
his support and he served at one time as the postmaster of South Seaville. 
He took an active part in religious work, was a leading and influential mem- 
ber of the Calvary Baptist church and served as one of its trustees. He 
married Sarah Corson, who still survives her husband. They became the 
parents of three children : Cecelia, Remington and William. The last named 
died in childhood, and the daughter became the wife of Frederick Corson, a 
sea captain of South Seaville, by whom she had three sons,— Newell S.. Wal- 
ter S. and Clarence. 

Remington Corson, the Doctor's father, was born in South Seaville, Cape 
May county, in 1843, attended the public schools and was also a student in 
Pierce's Business College. He received a thorough business training and 
was a member of the first class that graduated at that institution. He subse- 
quently went to sea and three years later he assumed the management of his 
father's general mercantile establishment in South Seaville, conducting the 
business^'for twentv-one years. In 1881 he was elected the sheriflf of the 
county and retired from commercial life. He was afterward the postmaster 
of South Seaville, under President Harrison, serving for five years, and had 
been the first postmaster of the town, at which time he served for nineteen 
consecutive vears. He was recognized as one of the leading workers in the 
ranks of the'Republican party and was frequently solicited to become a can- 
didate for the legislature, but always refused. He was also a very prominent 
Mason and one of the charter members of Cannon Lodge, No. 104, F. & A. 
M at South Seaville. filling all of its offices and ser\'ing as the master of the 
lodge for a number of years. He is a Knight Templar Mason and has taken 
sixt^een degrees in the Scottish rite. In the Baptist church he held a mem- 
bership and was its treasurer for a number of years. He wedded Mary P. 
York and three children were born to them: William, who died in infancy: 
Charles B., and Sarah, wife of Martin S. Grace, a railroad man. The father 
died April 21, 1894, at the age of fifty-one years, and the mother is still living 
at the age of fifty-seven. 

Dr. Corson has spent his entire life in the county of his nativity and 



IS8 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

acquired his preliminan- education in the pubhc schools of South Seaville. 
He further continued his studies under private instruction, and then took 
up the study of medi.cine with the intention of making its practice his Hfe 
work. On the 7th of June, 1894, he was graduated at the University of 
Pennsylvania with the degree of M. D. and located in practice in South 
Seaville; but this was his first experience in the field of labor, 
for in 1887 he had been appointed a page in the state senate and had 
served for three years. He had also been assistant postmaster under Presi- 
dent Harrison's administration. The Doctor was elected in November, 1899, 
coroner of Cape May county for a term of three years. In the prosecution 
of his chosen calling he has been very successful, and now has a liberal 
patronage that many an older member of the medical fraternity might well 
envy. He is a member of the Cape May County Medical Society and is now 
serving as its secretary. He has written some articles for medical journals, 
including reports of important and interesting cases, and has already gained 
marked prestige in his profession. 

On the 22d of April, 1897, the Doctor was united in marriage to Miss 
Theresa T. Corson, a daughter of Nicholas and Priscilla Corson, a successful 
teaciier then residing in South Dennis, New Jersey. They now have one 
child, Edmund Remington Corson. In South Seaville they ha\-e a wide 
acquaintance, and the circle of their friends almost equals the number of their 
acquaintances. 



BENJAAIIN T. ABBOTT, M. D. 

Among those who devote their time and energies to tlie practice of 
medicine and have gained a leading place in the ranks of the profession, is 
Dr. Abbott, of Ocean City. Success in any line of occupation, in any avenue 
of business, is not a matter of spontaneity, but is the legitimate offspring 
of subjective effort in the proper utilization of the means at hand, the im- 
provement of opportunity and the exercise of the highest functions made 
possible by the specific ability in any case. It is through such channels 
that Dr. Abbott has won prestige in the medical fraternity, having long 
since left the ranks of the many to stand among the successful few. 

The Doctor was born in Tuckahoe, Cape May county, August 6, 1845. 
and is of English lineage. The early annals of the family account for its 
origin in America by recording that the first progenitor of the family on 
American soil came from Abbotsford, England, in colonial days. The Doc- 
tor's parents were John C. and Ann (Treen) Abbott. The father, a native 
of Salem county, was educated in the public schools and under private in-

struction, after which he engaged in teaching. He also studied surveying 
and became one of the best known surveyors in southern New Jersey, his 
services being widely sought in various sections of the state. He further 
extended the field of his labors liy acting as foreman of various iron works 
on both sides of the Alleghany mountains, being thus engaged for many 
years. He was also extensively engaged in the lumber business, operated a 
sawmill and was the owner of three hundred and sixty acres of cedar swamp, 
one of the most valuable in southern New Jersey. He had a farm of one 
hundred acres of tillable land and his last days were devoted to agricultural 
pursuits. His varied and well managed business interests brought to him 
wealth, and his prominence in connection with the industrial and public 
afifairs of the comnuniity made him a leading and influential citizen. He 
was the judge of the court for several years at ]\Iay's Landing, and by 
other judges at different times in his life was frequently appointed as a com- 
missioner on the division of estates. 
He was a man of clear, calm judg- 
ment, of unquestioned probity and 
of sterling worth, and no trust ever 
given into his keeping was ever be- 
trayed. When a young man he 
was a member of a militia com- 
pany, and took part in the training 
of those early days. Long a faith- 
ful member of the Alethodi^t 
church, he served as superintend- 
ent of the Sunday-school at Alay's 
Landing for 35 years, and labored 

earnestly to instill into young minds principles which would guide and benefit 
them through life, and to introduce the benefits and blessings of Christianity 
among those of more mature years. His last days were spent at May's 
Landing, and in his death the community lost one of its most honored and 
valued citizens. 

John C. Abbott was the father of eight children. William T., the eldest, 
is a ^Methodist minister at Ocean Grove, but on account of the partial 
loss of his voice he is now living retired, only occasionally filling the pulpit. 
He is a member of the New Jersey conference, and during the civil war he 
served as the chaplain of the Twenty-third New Jersey Volunteer Infantrv. 
At the battle of Winchester his hat was shot from his head! He married 
Miss Rebecca Gilbert, of Burlington, New Jersey, and their children are 
Kate, wife of George Morrow, a caterer of Jersey City, New Jersey; Estella; 




i6o BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

and William G., a druggist. John G., the second of the children of John C. 
Abbott, was educated in the public schools and engaged in school-teaching 
until his enlistment in the Forty-eighth Independent Regiment from New- 
York city, composed of bank officers, teachers and professional men. He 
was wounded in an assault on Fort Wagner and died from the eiifect of his 
injuries eight days later, at Fort Hamilton. New York. J. E. Potts, the 
next of the family, was educated in New Jersey, in the law department of 
the University of Pennsylvania, and under the instruction of Judge Wood- 
hull, of Camden. In early life he engaged in teaching and has since prac- 
ticed law at May's Landing. Clark W. w-as a sea captain for several years and 
w'as also engaged in farming, lumbering and dealing in coal. He married 
Isabel, a daughter of Captain Joseph Wilson, of May's Landing. The Doc- 
tor is the next of the family. Rebecca is deceased. Maggie is the widow 
of J. Robert Kenney, who died in 1899. He is the son of Rev. Edward 
J. Kenney and was born in Philadelphia and for many years was postmaster 
of the city of Wahoo, Nebraska, where he was engaged in the dry-goods 
and millinery business. Charles studied law with his brother, and' is the 
present member from Atlantic county to the state legislature. The father 
of these children died in 1894, at the advanced age of ninety years, and 
thus was ended a long and useful life over which there fell no shadow of 
wrong or suspicion of evil. 

Dr. Abbott, whose name introduces the initial paragraph of this review, 
was educated in the public schools of Atlantic and Cape May counties and 
afterward engaged in teaching school in the former county, and was also the 
principal of the Middletown Academy, in Delaware. He afterward filled 
the office of deputy clerk of the court of Atlantic county for three years, 
and then, with a determination to become a member of the medical pro- 
fession, entered the Jefiferson Medical College, of Philadelphia, in which 
he was graduated in March, 1870. He took a special course in anatomy, 
surgery and gynecology, receiving separate diplomas for the work he had ac- 
complished in those branches of the medical science. In his practice he 
has made a specialty of gynecology and surgery, and in these special de- 
partments he has patients in all sections of the state and in Philadelphia. 
His knowledge along these lines is accurate and profound, and his treat- 
ment of such diseases has been followed li_\' most excellent results. His 
reputation has thus extended far and wide, and he is frequently called in 
consultation to Atlantic, Tuckahoe, Sea Isle City and other places in southern 
New Jersey. From 1870 until 1873 he engaged in practice at May's Land- 
ing, and then became the successor of his old preceptor, Dr. E. L. B. Wales, 
at Tuckahoe. a brother of Surgeon General Wales of the United States

Navy, remaining in Tuckahoe until 1896. He then came to Ocean City, 
where he has since made his home. He came to this place in order to get 
away from a practice whose extensive proportions and great responsibilities 
were ruining his own health, and now he has all that he can attend to or 
cares to undertake in the line of his profession. For twenty years he was 
also engaged in the drug business in Tuckahoe. He is a member of the 
New Jersey State Medical Society and the Cape May County Medical So- 
ciety, and is a member of the board of censors of the Medico-Chirurgical 
College, of Philadelphia, a position which he has occupied since Jnly i, 1894. 
He was also offered a chair in the institution, but declined to fill it. He has 
performed some of the most delicate and difiScult operations known to sur- 
gery and has an American endoscope (the X-ray instrument) for surgical 
work. His practice in surgery and gynecology is greater than that of any 
other physician in Cape May county. His success as a surgeon is due to his 
wonderfully minute and accurate acquaintance with anatomy, combined with 
an excellent power of diagnosis, a cool head, steady muscles and great me- 
chanical genius. 

The Doctor has successfully performed many very difficult operations 
in removing cancers and tumors and is now compiling a work which will be 
a history of fifty cases of cancer, which have come under his immediate at- 
tention. In this he will endeavor to show that the prevalence of cancer in 
this country is due to intermarriage between blood relations, proving this 
to be the fact in ninety-nine out of every hundred cases. Dr. .\bbott has 
also contributed some very valuable articles to medical journals, showing 
wide research, earnest thought and original investigation. 

Dr. Abbott has been thrice married. On Christmas day in 1869 he 
wedded Miss Hattie Blew, of Bridgeton, New Jersey, and to them were 
born three children: Anna M., wife of Reuben C. Little, a bookkeeper of 
Philadelphia, by whom she had one child, now deceased; Lizzie L., at home; 
and Lida May, wife of George L. Parsons, a merchant of Tuckahoe. For his 
second wife the Doctor chose Emma C. Godfrey, a daughter of Judge Heze- 
kiah Godfrey, of Tuckahoe. His present wife bore the maiden name of 
Adella Corson, and was a daughter of Captain Sylvester Corson, a sea cap- 
tain, who for many years resided at Palermo, Cape INIay countv. 

Although Dr. Abbott has attained an eminent position in his profes- 
sion he has yet found time to aid in the amelioration of those affairs which 
concern the community, antl has served as president of the board of health 
since his arrival in Ocean City. He has also been the president of the board 
of education throughout the same period, and has done much to advance 
the interests of the schools in this localitv. He has been an Odd Fellow for 



i62 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

twenty-five years, holding his memljership in Lodge No. 67, at Tuckahoe. 
He is also a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen and of the 
Jnnior Order of American Mechanics, and he belongs to the Methodist 
Episcopal church. 

His success in a professional way affords the best evidence of his capa- 
bilities, and no physician has ever observed more closely the ethics of the 
unwritten professional code or showed more careful courtesy to his fellow 
practitioners than does he. Almost as a sacred trust he seems to hold his 
professional offices, and it has been his careful attention, his earnest stud}' 
and his deep and abiding human sympathy that have Iirought him a flis- 
tinguished position in professional circles. 



JACOB P. COLLINS. 



Practical industry wisely and vigorously applied never fails of success; it 
carries a man onward and upward, brings out his individual character and 
acts as a powerful stimulus to the efforts of others. The greatest results in 
life are usually attained by simple means and the exercise of the 
ordinary qualities of common sense and perseverance. The every-day 
life, with its cares, necessities and duties, affords ample opportunities for 
acquiring experience of the best kind, and its most beaten paths afford a 
true worker aljundant scope for effort and self-improvement. It has been 
in the legitimate channels of trade that Jacob Peterson Collins has attained 
a leading position in industrial circles in Cape May county, making him 
one of the substantial citizens of the community. He belongs to that class 
of representative Americans who while promoting individual prosperity also 
add to the material welfare by promoting commercial activity, whereon 
depends the progress and improvement of town, county or state. 

A resident of South Seaville, Cape May county, he was born in Estel- 
ville, Atlantic county, New Jersey, December 16, 1845, his parents being 
Smith and Priscilla (Peterson) Collins. The family has long been repre- 
sented in this state. The great-grandfather resided in upper New Jersey, and 
his widow removed to Atlantic county with two of her sons, one being Jo- 
seph, the grandfather of our subject. She afterward married again and re- 
moved to the west, from which time all trace of her was lost. Joseph Collins 
was reared in Estelville, became a sawyer and followed that and other occu- 
pations in pursuit of fortune. He married a Miss Judith Steelman. and their 
children were Steelman. who married Mary Homan; Daniel, who married 
Martha Estell; John; Smith; Hannah, the wife of Somers Townsend; and 
Millicent. the wife of Daniel Hoffman. 



C0XGRESSI0X.4L DISTRICT OF .V£ff JERSEY 163 

Smitli Collins, father of our subject, was born in Estelville. Atlantic 
countv, in 1805. became a sawyer and followed that pursuit in connection 
with farming. His political support was given the Republican party, and 
he was deeply interested in its success, doing all in his power to ]3romote its 
growth. He also belonged to the Sons of Temperance and was a man whose 
upright life and probity made him respected 1)y all. His children were Som- 
ers Harrison, who married Jane detzminger, by whom he had three chil- 
dren, — Smith and two deceased. The mother died and he then wedded ^lary 
Champion, by whom he had a daughter, Ida. He was a farmer and also 
engaged in the lumber business in Ocean City. Harry S., a farmer of Estel- 
ville, married Ella Steelman, and their children were Ann, Jesse, Rosa, Ada 
and Harry. Jacob P. is the next of the family. Elizabeth married John 
English, who formerly engaged in teaching but now follows farming at 
English Creek, New Jersey, and they have one child. Ion. Naomi is the 
youngest. The father died in 1877, at the age of seventy-two years, and left 
to his children the priceless heritage of the good name which is rather to 
he chosen than great riches. 

Jacob Peterson Collins pursued his education in the public schools of 
Estelville until seventeen years of age and then devoted his energies to the 
work of field and meadow upon the home farm until he had attained his ma- 
joritv. He learned the wheelwright's trade in Absecon, New Jersey, follow- 
ing that pursuit for three years, after which he engaged in carriage-making 
at May's Landing until 1874. In that year he came to Cape May and fol- 
lowed the business of wheelwright for a time, but subsequently he took up 
surveying and still later engaged in the manufacture of sash, doors and blinds, 
and in the conduct of a sawmill at South Seaville. His factory was burned 
in 1889, but with characteristic energy he rebuilt, erecting a fine fire-proof, 
corrugated-iron structure, in which he manufactures all kinds of building ma- 
terials and deals in oil, glass and nails. This is one of the leading industries in 
this section of the county, furnishing employment to a large force of worJ<;- 
men and bringing to the owner a handsome competence. He buys timber, 
which he cuts into logs and converts into finished lumljer. As has been 
indicated, he has gradually increased and extended the field of his Inisiness 
operations as his capital has grown, and is now numbered among the promi- 
nent and successful business men of his part of the county. He is the owner 
of a valuable farm of fifty-five acres in Dennis township. Cape May county, 
and speculates to a considerable extent in land. He is a man of excellent 
judgment and is rarely at fault in his estimate of land values and their prob- 
able rise. He is also a member of the South Seaville Building & Loan Asso- 
ciation and represents the enterjirise as solicitor. 



i64 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

On the I2th of May. 1880, ]Mr. Collins married Miss Sarah Somers Town- 
send, a daughter of David Townsend. a sea captain at Ocean View and a 
granddaughter of Henry Young Townsend, who was one of a family of ten 
children. She was the fourth in order of birth in a family of six children, 
the others being Shamgar, Cornelia. Edith, Nicholas and Lewis C. To Mr. 
and Mrs. Collins have been born two children, — Edna and Harold. — who 
are still with their parents. The family attend the Calvar\- Baptist church, 
of which Mr. Collins is a consistent and zealous member. He has served as 
its treasurer for ten years and for a similar period its clerk. His entire lite 
has been characterized by the strictest fidelity to every trust reposed in him, 
by the most honorable and straightforward dealing in business and by devo- 
tion to and support of all interests which are calculated to promote the 
material, social and moral welfare of the community with which he is con- 
nected. 



HON. RICHARD C. MH^LER. 

One of the leaders in the Republican party of New Jersey is the Hon. 
Richard C. Miller, a lifelong resident of the town of Alloway, Salem county. 
He enjoys the respect and high regard of an extremely large circle of 
friends, in the business, political and social world, and the following brief 
narrative of his career will prove of interest to many of his acquaintances. 

The paternal great-grandparents of Mr. Miller came to New Jersey from 
Germany, and it is believed that they settled in Cumberland county. Their 
son, John Miller, who accompanied them from the Fatherland, was twice 
married, both of his wives bearing the surname of Hitchner. He dwelt upon 
a homestead in Friesburg, Salem county, which property belonged to one 
of these wives, and during his time he was accounted to be one of the thrifty 
and successful agriculturists of that locality. Martin, deceased, who was 
engaged in farming in the vicinity of Salem, was the only child of the first 
marriage, and to the second union there were born the following named 
children: George, a farmer of Cumberland county; John, who lived at 
Greenwich, New Jersey, but died in early manhood; Samuel W. ; Anna. IMrs. 
Riley of Bridgeton, New Jersey; and Mary, who never married and who 
died in Philadelphia. 

Samuel \V. Miller, the father of our subject, was born near Greenwich. 
New Jersey, in 1808. In early life he was occupied in cabinet-making, but 
later he gave his exclusive attention to the lumber business. Owning a 
sawmill near Alloway. he manufactured lumber on an extensive scale, and 
continued successfullv engaged in this line of business until his death, in

queathed a sawmill to the last named. Anthony Ludlam. Sr.. took up his 
residence at Dennisville upon the south side of the creek m 1726, and a 
few years later his brother Joseph took up his abode on the north side of 

the stream. , 

The former's son. Anthony Ludlam. Jr. was the great-grandfather of our 
subject He possessed considerable executive ability and was a man of enter- 
prise and marked character. For a long time he ser^^ed as a judge of the 
county court, and was also an active and influential business man. From 
the heayy timber he cleared a farm upon which Furman Ludlam now resides, 
and ther'e he built a dam and erected a saw and grist mill at the head ot 
'Sluice creek He also had a deer park, in which he raised his own deer, and 
throughout the country side he was known as one of the leading landholders 
and business men. He married a daughter of Judge Henn- Young and to 
them were born six children: Anthony. Joseph. Reuben. Providence Eliza- 
beth and Judith. Of this family Anthony married and at his death left four 
children- James, the grandfather of our subject: Rachel. Rhoda and Lovicia. 
James Ludlam was born in South Dennis and became an extensive 
land-owner, having several valuable farms. He also owned and operated 
gristmills, and successfully managed his large business interests, acquiring 
a handsome competence. He served as the judge of the court, was a jtistice 
of the peace and held other local offices. He gave the land upon which the 
Union church was built and the cemetery laid out and was always a 
liberal subscriber for the financial needs of the church. He married Martha 
Johnson, a daughter of David Johnson, and their children were Anthony, 
Christopher. James J.. Jeremiah J.. Abijah S.. Amelia. Sarah and Rachel. 

Christopher Ludlam. the father of our subject, was born in South Dennis, 
July 21 1796. and there spent his entire life, his energies being devoted to 
farming and to the operation of a flouring mill. His work was systemat- 
ically and carefully managed, and thus allowed him time to perform other 
duties of life in connection with citizenship and church relations. He gave 
his political support to the Democracy, and was a zealous and active mem- 
ber of the Methodist Episcopal church, serving as a member of its board of 
trustees, and doing all in his power to promote the growth and advance 
the cause of the church. He was an aggressive temperance worker, and 
at all times labored earnestly for the measures which he believed would 
benefit mankind. In the state militia he held the rank of lieutenant. 
Christopher Ludlam was twice married. On the 9th of April, 181 7. he 
wedded Maria Swain, and to them were born the following children: Ann 
C, who was born February 10. 1820. and died September 18, 1821: J^Ionroe, 
who was l)orn November i. 1821, and died :\L^rch 26, 1823: Harriet, who was

born December 14, 1823, and died July 10, 1824; and Charles, who was 
born June 10, 1818, and died October 30, 1847. The mother of these 
children passed away December 22, 1823, and on the 15th of July, 1825, Mr. 
Ludlam married Hannah Swain, who was born April 11. 1802, and was a 
daughter of Captain Henry Swain, who made his home at Ocean View. 
Cape May county, but was the commander of a vessel and died at sea. In 
connection with his brother Joshua and his father, Jacoks Swain, he invented 
the center board, which has since had an important place in the manipu- 
lation of sail vessels. He also owned a farm in Cape May county. His 
wdfe bore the maiden name of Elizabeth Holmes, and by their marriage 
they became the parents of seven children: Robert, who married a lady in 
Louisiana and died in New Orleans; Reuben, who served in the navy in the 
civil war and' is now deceased: James, who married Sophia Swain: Millicent. 
the wife of Stillwell Hildreth: Priscilla, wife of Abijah Ludlam: Judith, and 
Mrs. Ludlam. The parents of our subject had ten children: Amelia L., 
W'ho was born February 28. 1827, and died in early life; Maria L., who was 
born May 20, 1828, and became the wife of Leaming M. Rice; Francis A., 
who was born July 24, 1829, and married Lizzie Buchanan, by whom he 
had two children, — Mary and Harry; Joshua S., who was born September 
13. 1831, and wedded Marv Hall, by whom he had three children. William 
H.. H. Swain and Ella P.; Robert A., who was born August 15, 1833, and 
died in California, July 22, 1872, unmarried: Edwin, who was born December 
2y, 1834, and married Sarah Wentzel, their children being Harry, Clara 
and Hannah; William B., who was born August 30, 1836, and died in 
childhood: Benjamin F., who was born May 4, 1838, and married Martha 
Hunter, of Missouri, by whom he had six children: William, Lizzie. Han- 
nah, Frank, Sallie and John; Jesse D,, of this review; and Mary D., who 
was born September 15, 1841, and is the wife of George F. Brinkerhoflf, of 
Missouri. The father of these children died November 15, 1861, and the 
mother's death occurred March 24, 1883. 

Hon. Jesse Diverty Ludlam, whose name introduces this record, of one 
of the oldest and most distinguished families of New Jersey, was born at 
South Dennis, where he yet makes his home, February 28. 1840. He 
obtained his education in the public schools of Cape May county and in 
Pennington Seminary, where he pursued his studies until twenty years of 
age, when he took up the practical duties of life by following agricultural 
pursuits upon the farm upon which he now resides. Since that time he has 
been connected with the farming interests of Cape May county and is the 
owner of one hundred and twenty acres of rich land which is under a high 
state of cultivation. In the supervision of his farm he follows the most pro- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 169 

gressive methods, and the latest improved machinery enables him to make his 
place one characterized by neatness and indicative of the thrift and enterprise 
of the owner. He also deals in cedar lumber and is the owner of large tracts 
of timber land. He manufactures lumber on an extensive scale, and in 
addition to supplying the large local demand he ships a considerable amount. 
Upon his farm he has erected a beautiful and modern residence, containing 
fifteen rooms. It is a tasteful style of architecture, built after his own plan 
and finished throughout in hard wood, — making it one of the finest homes 
in the locality. 

Mr. Ludlam is an inflexible adherent of Democracy and actively labors 
to promote the interests of the party. He has been a member and chair- 
man of the town committee, was district clerk of the public schools for 
twenty-five years and from 1881 until 1883 he was a member of the board 
of chosen freeholders. For four years he was the inspector of elections, 
and in 1879 he was elected to the general assembly by a majority of eighteen 
over Lewis Williams, the Republican candidate; in 1883 he was re-elected by 
a majority of eighty-nine; in 1884 by a majority of one hundred and fifty-four, 
and in 1885 by a majority of one hundred and thirty. No higher testimonial 
of his ei^cient service could be given than his increased majorities, which 
indicates how ably and loyally he has labored for the interests of his constitu- 
ents and his state. It is a well known epigram that "a man may fool all the 
people some of the time, some of the people all of the time, but he can't fool 
all of the people all of the time;" and as long as the ballot is in the hands 
of the American citizen the outlook for our American politics is not a gloomy 
one, for although unworthy men may gain ofiice they cannot retain it except 
through faithful service. It is therefore evident that the people have great 
confidence in Mr. Ludlam and that the trust which they repose in him has 
never been betrayed. He was appointed a lay judge of Cape May county by 
Governor Abbett and served for seven years, or until the office was abolished 
in 1896. He served for two years, filling out the unexpired term of Judge 
Diverty, and was then appointed, April i, 1892, for the full term of five years. 
For eighteen years he has been the treasurer of the Dennisville Building & 
Loan Association. 

On the 3d of November, 1861, Mr. Ludlam was married to Miss Emily 
C. Miller. Her paternal grandfather, Elijah Miller, was a native of Cape 
]\Iay county, and followed farming on Green creek, where he spent his last 
days. He was a prominent member in the Alethodist Episcopal church and 
aided in its various efforts to uplift mankind. He married Phoebe Smith, 
and their children were Vincent, who married Mary Cameron, of Philadel- 
phia, and a daughter of Angus and Margaret Cameron, formerly of Scotland: 



I70 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Mary, the wife of Captain Benajah Tomlin, hy wliom she had seven chihh-en; 
Deborah and Smith, who died unmarried. After the death of his first wife 
Mr. Miller wedded Catherine McKinnis. and to them was born a daughter, 
Margaret, who married Rev. Jacob Price. The father of Mrs. Ludlam was 
born at Green Creek, Cape May count}-, November 6, 1812, and throughout 
his life followed farming. He wedded Mary Cameron, and four children were 
born to them: ]\Iargaret, the wife of Dr. George G. Carll, of Salem, New 
Jersey, b}- whom she had four children, — A. Lincoln. Alfred. Mary and 
Helen; Airs. Emily Ludlam, and Phoebe S. and Mary R.. who are engaged 
in teaching. After the death of his first wife the father married Priscilla 
Buck, and their children are \'incent O., Ella. Elijah. Belle. Frank and 
Smith. 

To Mr. and Mrs. Ludlam have been born three children: Leslie S.. Mar-,

Woodstown boasts of no more patriotic, public-spirited citizen than he 
whose name heads this sketch. During his early manhood and prime he 
was interested in agriculture, and in this peaceful vocation made a compe- 
tence for old age. Whatever affects the farmer is a matter of prime im- 
portance to him, and in numerous ways he has manifested his interest in the 
welfare and progress of the agriculturists of Salem county. 

Both he and his parents, as well as several generations of their families, 
have been inhabitants of this county and state. The father, John, and Ph.il- 
enion lived to manhood, Thomas dying in his childhood. John Dickinson 
took an important place in his time and community, for vears was a farmer 
and merchant of Sharptown. Salem county, was the captain of a militia com-

\-j2 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

HOWARD A. WILSON. 

Howard Atkinson Wilson, ]\I. D., a prominent physician of Woodbury. 
Gloucester county, New Jerse}-, was born in Haddonfield, Camden county, 
this state, September i, 1859, and is a son of Rev. James Eli and Esther 
(Bateman) Wilson. The Wilson family originated in Wales, althoiig-h the 
grandfather, James H. W'ilson, was a native and lifelong resident of Phila- 
delphia, in which city he engaged in the manufacture of boots and shoes. 
He was the father of three children: ]\lary -\nn, deceased, who married 
Thomas L. Atkinson, of Camden: Clark, who married and left four children 
at his death, which occurred in early life; and James Eli. 

James Eli Wilson was born in Philadelphia March 17. 1830, and obtained 
his early education in the public schools of that city, later entering Louisburg 
University, afterward called Bucknell University, where he took a theological 
course and graduated. He was ordained a minister in the Baptist church and 
labored faithfully in the vineyard of the Master until his life of usefulness 
was ended by death June 14, 1895, when his mortal remains were laid to rest 
in the Presbyterian cemetery of Blackwood, this state. A pleasing and elo- 
quent speaker, he gained the ready sympathy of his audience and brought 
many souls to a sense of their sinfulness and the knowledge of the power and 
love of an all-wise Father, and was the humble leader of many who sought 
the fold. As chaplain of the Ninety-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers during 
the late rebellion he was faithful in the discharge of his duties and gave sym- 
pathy to many a wretched sufiferer. His marriage to Miss Esther Bateman 
took place November 7, 1850, and was blessed with a large number of chil- 
dren. Joseph Kennard, the eldest, born June 29. 1852, was married October 
4, 1876, to Miss Lucy Taylor, who was born Octolaer 20. 185 1, and resides 
in Portland, Maine; Annie Elizabeth, born March 19, 1854, died the follow- 
ing December; Edgar Clark, born August 6, 1856, married Mary Brace, 
the widow of the late Dr. Clayton, and resides in Blackwood, Camden county, 
this state; Howard Atkinson is the next of the family; Elmer Ellsworth, born 
June I, 1862. married Miss Lucile Hollis, July 10, 1884, and resides at Black- 
wood; Harry Bateman, born October 26, 1864, lives in Philadelphia; and 
Helen Augusta, born October 18, 1868, is also living in Philadelphia. Mrs. 
Esther Wilson is now residing in Philadelphia in her seventieth year. At 
the beginning of the present century, on April 26, 1800, Stephen Bateman 
was born in the town of Southway, Connecticut, to a famih- in the rural dis- 
tricts. Blessed with a good, sound body, he was given plenty of fresh air 
and hard work and laid the foundation of a rugged constitution that carried 
him to the ripe old age of eighty-seven years — years that were filled with

kindly deeds and beautiful thoughts. Three }ears later, on April 23, 1803. 
in the neighboring town of Nagatuck,. Connecticut, IMaria Benham first 
opened her eyes to the light of day. These two grew to youthful years, met 
and loved each other with an ardor that culminated in their betrothal, and on 
September 20, 1826, they were duly joined in the silken cords of matrimony. 
Ten children were added as a blessing to their home, and their descendants 
are now to be found in almost every quarter of our broad land. Harriet 
Goodyear, their eldest child, was l)om November 23, 1827, and married Jo- 
seph Morgan Coles, January 29, 185 1; Esther, born August 8, 1829, married 
James Eli Wilson and is the mother of our subject; Cynthia Goodyear, liorn 
August 6, 1831. married Robert Johnson Burt, May 4, 1853: Augusta Hoad- 
ley, born March i, 1834, married William W. Heritage, November 7, 1859; 
Helen Caroline, bom August 20, 1836, married Benjamin Smith E\erett, 
June 9, 1864; Edward S., born September 29, 1838, married Sallie \\'. \\'ood. 
November 21, 1871; Henry Clay. l)orn June, 1840, married Sallie A. \\Mlkins, 
April 2, 1868; Frank, born February 12, 1842, married Alice Rebecca Mar- 
shall, September 9, 1865; Harrison, born September 14, 1845, died August 
13. 1847; and Charles Lewis, born September 3, 1847, died January 21, 1857. 
Stephen Bateman died July 28, 1886, aged eighty-seven years, three 
months and twelve days. Spared beyond the ordinary allotment of life, his 
mental powers were unimpaired and his old age was one of comparative 
activity and comfort: although sight and hearing had, in a measure, failed 
him, yet he was able to enjoy the companionship of his family and friends and 
to the last took a lively interest in all their affairs. Possessed of a generous 
nature, he was a source of constant blessing to others, but too free to favor 
the personal accumulation of wealth. He was a blacksmith l)y trade, and 
one of the best in that section. Always ready and willing to oblige and 
befriend his neighbors, he bestowed upon his labors for their convenience 
the greatest care, yet often did they tax both patience and skill, even after 
his retirement from active life. Wherever he was he always found some 
deed of usefulness and unselfishness to perform and the accomplishment of 
it afforded him the keenest pleasure. He was of a cheerful, social disposition 
and ever ready with joke or song to beguile a tedious hour or give amuse- 
ment to those around him. He was of a deeply religious nature, although he 
was undemonstrative and his innate diffidence kept him from publiclv affirm- 
ing it, yet his faith was observable in his every-day life and bound him to 
the strict performance of his Christian duties. In his chamber were his 
Bible and books of spiritual texts, and often was his voice heard in private 
devotion and supplication. He ripened spiritually as physical strength de- 
clined, and though his death was sudden it did not find him unprepared.

and was but the fitting climax to a beautifully rounded Christian life. His 
wife had preceded him across the silent river on Xoxember 3, 1873. '>"cl 
there awaited a blissful reunion. The descendants of this worthy couple 
hold a family reunion each year at the residence of some of the members 
and the minutes of each meeting- are regularly printed in pamphlet form for 
souvenirs of the occasion. 

Howard A. Wilson was a student in the public schools of Burlington. 
New Jersey, and there acquired the greater part of his primary education. 
Later he attended the South Jersey Institute at Bridgeton and subsequently 
entered the Polytechnic College at Providence, Rhode Island. He then 
took a medical course in the Jefiferson Medical College, in Philadelphia, 
graduating in that institution March 29, 1884. He read medicine under the 
guidance of Dr. Elisha Munger, of Niantic. Connecticut, and opened an oflfice 
for the practice of his profession in Deerfield, Cumberland county. New 
Jersey, in 1884. After remaining there two years he located in \^'oodbury. 
where he enjoys a continuous and extended patronage from the best class of 
patients, although his services are willingly bestowed on rich and poor alike, 
and many an unfortunate sufferer has had cause to bless the kind heart and 
ministering hand of Dr. Wilson. 

He was married near Woodstown, this state, to Mary E. Morgan, daugh- 
ter of the late Israel L. and Talitha (Conover) Morgan, the ceremony being 
performed September 4, 1889. They have three children: Howard A., born 
December 8, 1890; Mary Esther, wdio was born July 12. 1893, and died on 
the 27th of the following June, and Alice Morgan, born October 2, 1899. 
The Doctor is a member of the New Jersey State Medical Society and the 
Gloucester County Medical Society, is an honorary member of the Salem 
County Medical Society, and a member of the Woodbury Board of Educa- 
tion. He is a Republican in his political views and a member of the Baptist 
church, of wliich he is a deacon and president of the board of trustees. 



JONATHAN C. JAMES. 

Jonathan C. James, who is engaged in farming and in the manufacture 
of lumber near Sea Isle Junction, was born in Dennisville. New Jersey. 
April 26, 1829, his parents being Enoch and Nancy (Hitchner) James. His 
father was a native of South Dennis, this state, and was a wheelwright, mill- 
wright and farmer. For many years he was a resident of Dennisville, and 
there his death occurred. During the war of 181 2 he joined the army and 
served as a fifer. His political support was given the men and measures of 



COXGRESSIOX.^L DISTRICT OF XEJF JERSEY. 175 

the Democracy. In his family were six children, — four sons and two 
daughters: Maria, the wife of -\hraham Reeves; Thomas, a carpenter, who 
married Susan Ross, by whom he had two daughters, — Anna Eliza and 
Mar\- Jane; Enoch, a farmer, carpenter and contractor, who married Maria 
Townsend and had four children, — Enoch, Fannie. Maria and Fred; Hannah, 
wife of James Ludlow, a farmer and sea captain, by whom she had three chil- 
dren, — John, Anna and Frank; John, a carpenter, who wedded Mary Carroll, 
their children being Bell. Harry and Bertha; and Jonathan C. of this review. 
The father of these children died at the age of seventy-five years, and the 
mother passed away at the age of eighty-four years. 

Jonathan C. James pursued his education in the Ludlam school, in Den- 
nisville, and afterward learned the carpenter's trade, which he followed for 
twenty-five years. On the expiration of that period he turned his attention 
to farming and to the lumber business, getting out timber and cord-wood 
and operating a steam sawmill near Seal Isle Junction. In this undertaking 
he has met with creditable success, and in addition to the conduct of the mill 
he owns and cultivates a farm of one hundred and sixty-five acres, which is 
highly improved and yields a good return for the labor and attention which 
Mr. James bestows upon it. He employs eight men in the sawmill, and the 
output of the mill finds a ready sale upon the local market. 

On the 2 1st of June, 1852, Mr. James was united in marriage to Miss 
Sarah Carroll, a daughter of Henry Carroll, and to them have been born 
four children, the eldest being Clara. Mary is the wife of Rev. Charles Law- 
rence, of Haddonfield, by whom she has two children, Edson and Mary. 
Charles, the third child of subject, married Lydia Robinson and has nine 
children; Milton, deceased; Sarah, Cora, Fannie, Jonathan, Alice, George 
and Harriet (twins), and Carroll. Anna, the youngest child of our subject, 
is the wife of Professor David Davis, of Haddonfield, New Jersey. 

Mr. James holds a membership in the Methodist Episcopal church, and 
in his political faith is a Democrat, but has never sought or desired office, 
preferring to devote his time and energies to his business interests, in which 
he is meeting with signal success. 



WILLI A]\I S. RICHMAN. 

\\"illiam S. Richman, of Malaga. Gloucester county, Xew Jersey, is the 
popular assessor of Franklin township, and resides on a farm near the vil- 
lage. He was born in this neighborhood, as was his father, Joshua Rich- 
man. His grandfather, Gideon, was of English parentage. Joshua Rich- 



176 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

man was a man who had made his own way in the world and had e\'ery rea- 
son to be proud of the progress he had made. He was a great reader and 
possessed a keen intelHgence that made him a man among men. He was a 
freeholder and held a number of other offices. He was a farmer and lumber- 
man, a shrewd business man and accumulated considerable property, which 
was divided among his children at his death in March, 1882. He was united 
in marriage with Miss Mary Kandle, a daughter of Adam Kandle, who bore 
him nine children, five of whom survive her. They are Adam K., a miller of 
this place; A. B., also a miller of this vicinity; Daniel, of New York; William 
S., our subject: and Gideon, who resides in the state of Pennsylvania. 

William S. Richman attended the common schools of his district in early 
life and soon began clerking in a store. In 1892 he was appointed the post- 
master of Malaga for four years, and his accommodating manners and cour- 
teous treatment would have won even any who were not already listed as 
his friends. He is well known in political circles and has held a number of 
township offices. In 1896 he was elected assessor and has discharged his 
duties in an able and conscientious manner. 

The lady whom he chose as his wife was formerly Miss Jennie Small- 
wood, the daughter of Samuel P. Smallwood, a resident of this section. 
They had three children, two of whom only are living, — Helen and Rachel. 
Mr. Richman has always affiliated with the Democratic party, but is a man 
who has warm friends in the ranks of both parties and is deserving of the 
esteem in which he is held. 



JOHN GAYNER. 

New Jersey is ]5re-eminentl\- a manufacturing state and ships her products 
to all parts of the world, and probably no town within her borders adds 
more to the shipping list than Salem. This thriving little city is situated in 
the county of that name, on the Salem river, and is directly connected, by 
the Delaware river, as well as by rail, with Philadelphia, which is the prin- 
cipal shipping point in this part of the county. Among the leading indus- 
tries which have contributed largely to the growth and prosperity of Salem 
is that owned and controlled by the Gayner Glass Company, which company 
is incorporated with a capital stock of fifty thousand dollars, with John Gay- 
ner as president; Edward Gayner, treasurer; and John W. Gayner, secretary. 
In the factory employment is furnished to a large force of operatives, and 
the mammoth business is the outgrowth of the personal efforts and industry

of John Gayner, whose name introduces this review, one of the most promi- 
nent business men in his section of the state. 

He was born Decemlser 5, 1831, and is a native of England as were his 
father and grandfather. The latter, John Gayner. Sr., was a resident of 
Bristol, England, where Edward Gayner, the father, was born and spent his 
entire life. There he was married, on the 7th of June, 1829, to Elizabeth 
Parker. He was celebrated in his native town for his abiUty as a manager, 
having charge of a glass factory into which he took his sons, teaching them 
the business. Three of them have made it their life occupation. The father 
died at the age of sixty-eight years and the mother passed away at the age of 
seventy-four. In their family were thirteen children, namely: Eliza, who 
was born July 5. 1830. died September 9, 1831 : John was born December 5, 
1831; Edward, born January 23. 1833, was in early life a glass-blower of 
Bristol, England, but afterward became a resident of Norristown, Pennsyl- 
vania: James, who was born October 3, 1834, located in Australia, where 
he engaged in the grocery business; Eliza, born February 15, 1836, died 
when about twenty-five years of age: Robert, born Sejitemlier 4, 1837, is 
a resident of Bristol, England: Richard, who is also living in Bristol, was 
born February 14, 1839; Frank, born November 2, 1840, located in San 
Francisco, California; Mary, born April 17, 1843, is still Hving in England: 
Mathew, who was bom in January, 1843, came to this country with his 
brother John, but soon returned to England, and his present place of resi- 
dence is not known to his family; Ann, born December 23, 1847, is still living 
in England; George, who learned the trade of shoemaking, is following that 
pursuit in the land of his nativity: and Hannah, born July 23, 1837, is married 
and resides in England. 

John Gavner is largely a self-educated as well as self-made man. Having 
little opportunity to attend the day schools, he pursued his studies in evening 
classes, and by reading and observation has added largely to his knowledge. 
At the age of twelve years he entered the glass works of which his father 
was manager, and after two years he was apprenticed to the firm of Coath- 
upes & Company, of Bristol, and Nailsea, England, for a seven-year term, 
to learn the art of window glass and shade blowing. He was to be paid 
seven shillings or about a dollar and seventy-five cents a week for the first 
vear and to receive a shilling additional each week through each succeeding 
year until his wages had become twelve shillings or three dollars ]3er week for 
the sixth and seventh years. The firm was so well pleased with the manner 
in which he served his apprenticeship that he was presented with the follow- 
ino- letter: 



178 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

SHEET & CROWN GLASS WORKS. 

February i, 1853. 
To all whom it may concern: The bearer. John Gayner, has served his 
time with us as a sheet-glass blower for seven years, and I have much pleasure 
in stating that throughout the whole of his time he conducted himself with 
strict propriety. — so much so as to induce us to enter upon an immediate en- 
gagement with him as a journeyman. He is a very good workman, and of 
sober, steady and industrious habits, superior to most of a similar class. I 
am further. Yours \-erv truly, 

Oliver Coathupes. 

The company offered him five pounds — twenty-five dollars — if he would 
enter into another agreement for another year as a journeyman and at the end 
of that time renewed their contract, and thus kept him in their service until 
their retirement from business about four years later. He was with that 
company and its successors for twelve years and then withdrew with the in- 
tention of engaging in business on his own account, having acquired quite 
a little capital as the result of his industry and economy. Accordingly he 
began operations in Bristol in an old deserted flint factory, manufacturing 
glass shades, but he found that he had very strong competition and that 
the enterprise would not prove a profitable one. For this reason he closed 
out the busiuicss, and, severing his home ties, started for the New World, 
taking passage on the Nova Scotia. He was accompanied by his wife and 
six children, and after about fourteen days spent on the water landed in Port- 
land, Maine, with twenty-five dollars in his pocket. The same day he took 
the train for Boston, where he secured a position in the Crystal Glass Works, 
being there employed until the last of July, when the factory closed down, 
never to resume business again. Finding himself out of work with a large 
family dependent upon him, and funds getting low, he started out again and 
obtained a position at Bergen Point, New Jersey. He entered upon the 
duties of his new position in August, and the following September that busi- 
ness also was closed down and did not resume operations until some time 
afterward, and never again at that place. 

Mr. Gayner then went to Syracuse, New York, but after four months 
passed there he was called home on account of the illness of his wife. He 
had entered the ser\'ice of the Syracuse company with the understanding 
that he might return to Caven Point when the old Bergen Point Company, 
which was to be reorganized, should need him. As that company was almost 
ready to resume business he did not return to Syracuse, but removed his 
family to Caven Point, the place where John William Gayner, the present 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEJV JERSEY. 179 

secretary of the Gayner Glass Company, was born. May 27. 1867. But the 
new place of residence afforded no school or church privileges and ^Ir. Gay- 
ner. with a desire to give his children good educational advantages, went to 
Xorristown. Pennsylvania, where a new glass factory was being opened 
under the management of Jacob Green. He accepted a position as window 
glass and shade blower and for two or three years was fortunate in having 
continuous work, during which jieriod. through the assistance of his estim- 
able wife, he was enabled to save some money. On the 27th of April. 1869. 
they made their first payment — nine hundred dollars — on their first little 
home, which they purchased of William Yaughan. Not long after this Mr. 
Gayner was otTered the position of manager of a window glass works at 
Wheeling. West Virginia, and removed to that place, where he remained until 
ofifered the position of superintendent of the factory at Norristown. in which 
he had formerly been employed. He then returned to the Keystone, and on 
leaving Wheeling he was given the following letter: 

To whom it may concern: The bearer. Air. John Gayner, has been in 
my employ as manager in the Window Glass House, and I hereby recommend 
him as a sober and capable man and competent superintendent. 

George W. Robinson. 

Wheeling, West Virginia, Dec.eml)er 29. 18^19. 

After taking charge of the Xorristown plant Mr. Gayner found it in a 
bad financial condition. He hoped to straighten out its affairs, however, and 
when asked to go on a note to pay the workmen he consented. He found, 
though, that the business was too much involved and the demands of the 
creditors could not be put oft. so that he lost all of his savings by this act of 
kindness. At the sheriff's sale a banker purchased the factory, but before 
doing so asked Mr. Gayner if he thought he could make a success of the 
business if money was furnished him. Mr. Gayner replied he thought he 
could, and accordingly was hired to superintend the works. After three 
verv successful years, during which the enterprise proved a very profitable one 
for its owner, and when he had just completed the furnaces for a fourth year's 
work, he was asked to resign. \\'ishing to know the reason for this he was 
told that the other workmen were dissatisfied (which was caused by a jealous 
spirit as they noted his advancement) and they persuaded the banker that 
it was useless to pay Mr. Gayner so much for managing when his own son 
could do just as well. The banker, desirous of saving the salary paid Mr. 
Gavner. fell in with the plan of the workmen and not only asked for Mr. 
Gayner's resignation but also collected the note which Mr. Gayner had signed 
for the bankrupt company, amounting to about two thousand dollars. 



l8o BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

The }ear following Mr. Gayner's retirement affairs moved with some 
degree of success in the factory, but with less the next year, and the third 
year he was asked to return and assume the management again. This he 
refused to do. and things kept going from bad to worse. Six times was he 
solicited to return, but each time he refused, and the factory was at length 
closed down and is now falling into decay. 

In the meantime Mr. Gayner, with the few hundred dollars which re- 
mained to him of his earnings, had removed his family to Waterford, New 
Jersey, in 1874, and there went into business with Maurice Raleigh. After 
two years Mr. Raleigh withdrew, and through the following year the business 
was conducted by the firm of Gayner & McDevitte. On the expiration of 
that period Mr. Gayner started a very small furnace for making glass shades 
and entered into partnership with S. J. Pardessus, of New York city. In 
July, 1879, they removed their business to Salem, New Jersey, where they 
employed six or seven men. The firm of Gayner & Pardessus was dissolved 
in the year 1885, the senior partner wishing to admit his sons to a partner- 
ship in the business. He considers that the substantial foundation of his 
present prosperity was laid during the years of his partnership with Mr. Par- 
dessus, for he found in him a true friend, to whom he feels most grateful. He 
is now- conducting the largest fruit-jar manufactory in the east, his sales 
amounting to over one hundred thousand dollars annually. Year by year 
his business has increased until it has assumed extensive proportions, and at 
the same time he has seen those who used him unfairly gradually lose their 
business until it was involved in utter failure. 

yh. Gayner has been twice married. He first wedded Frances Atkin, and 
to them were born six children, four of whom reached years of maturity. — 
Francis, Margaret, Edward J. and Frederick Charles. The mother of these 
children died at the age of twenty-eight years, and ]\Ir. Gayner was married 
October i, 1861, to Miss Elizabeth Wilkins. by whom he had several chil- 
dren, all of whom died in infancy, with the exception of J. William and Eliza 
Florence, the latter the wife of Frank Morrison, a clerk in the office of "Sir. 
Gayner. The mother was called to her final rest September 3, 1899. 

Since locating in Salem Mr. Gayner has made many friends by his honor- 
able dealing, and is now one of the most popular and esteemed citizens of 
the county. He is a valued member of the Independent Order of Odd Fel- 
lows and of the Methodist church, and is a public-spirited citizen who takes 
a commendable interest in everything pertaining to the welfare and progress 
of the community along educational, social, material and moral lines. His 
success is most creditable, being the result of his own well dire(fted efforts. 
His close application to business, his perseverance and capaljle management

have brought to him a degree of prosi)erity which numliers him among tlie 
wealthier men of his adopted county. His life is an exemplification of what 
mav be accomplished through determined purpose and laudable ambition in 
a land where merit and talent are not hampered by caste or class, and w here 
opportunity is o])en to all who care to advance. 



ED^^■ARD I. GAYNER. 



Edward J- Gavner occupies the prominent and responsible position of 
treasurer of the Gayner Glass Comj^any. and possesses undoubted business 
abilitv. He stands high in«the esteem of his fellow citizens and is considered 
a man of most exemplary character. 

He is a son of John and Frances Gayner and came to America w ith his; 
parents and four l^rothers and sisters when he was but a lad. He was born 
near Bristol. England, as were his father and grandfather, Edward Gayner. 
His grandfather was a prominent glass-worker in his native city and had the 
management of the factory situated in Bristol for many years. He married 
Eliza Parker and hafl twelve children, who are now widely scattered in dif- 
ferent parts of the world. James went to Australia, where he is a glass- 
lilower, and several of the sons sought homes in America, among them 
Frank, a resident of San T'rancisco, California; Edward, a glass-blower of 
Norristovvn, Pennsylvania: and John, the father of our subject. 

John Gayner had unusual advantages for becoming familiar with the 
work of glass-making, as he entered the factory as soon as his school days 
were ended, and remained there until he was proficient in the work. He 
married and had five children, when he decided to locate in America, which 
he did in 1866. After visiting several places, among them Boston, Massa- 
chusetts, Jersey City, New Jersey, Norristown. Pennsylvania, \\'heeling. 
West Virginia, and Waterforcl, this state, he settled in Salem and started a 
glass factory here in 1872. This was necessarily begun on a small scale and 
employed but six or se\en men. The business increased steadily, but he con- 
tinued at the same place until 1884. when the buildings were destroyed by 
fire, and then he rebuilt, on a more extensive scale. The factory now occu- 
pies four acres of land and is sup])lied with all modern machinery to facilitate 
the work, enabling them to turn out sixteen tons of goods per dav. He first 
married Frances Atkin, b)- whom he had six children, four of whom grew to 
manhood and womanhood, — Francis, Margaret. Edward J., our subject, and 
Frederick C. His second wife was Miss Elizabeth W'ilkins, who with her two 
children. William and Eliza Florence, are still living, the latter the wife of 
Frank Morrison, who is employed in the office of the glass companw

for thirty-two years, — a record which stands an unniistakaljle evidence of liis 
ability and faithfuhiess. He \\as a freeliolder for seven years, retiring from 
that office in 1874, and in the fall of the same year he was elected county 
sherifif, serving for four years. The county has usually given a Republican 
majority of from eight to twelve hundred, but he was elected on a Democratic 
ticket by a majority of six hundred, a fact w'hich indicates his personal popu- 
larity and the confidence reposed in him. On the i6th of February, i860, 
was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Jones and Miss Harriet S. Wilson, a 
daughter of Thomas Wilson, of Gloucester county, and a representative of a 
prominent family. They have two children, Harry W. and Wilson T.. both 
at home. The eldest son is now serving as a freeholder of the county, and the 
youngest one is serving as a township clerk. The family is one of prominence 
in the community and its representatives occupy envialjle positions in social, 
business and political circles. 



ROBERT T. SEAGRAVES. 

There is probably no man in the community, aside from those who have 
consecrated their lives to the ministry, who have exerted a stronger influence 
for the uplifting of humanity than Robert T. Seagraves. In business life 
he has achieved a splendid success and acquired a handsome competency, 
but though his business cares and responsibilities were many he has yet found 
time and opportunity to promote the interests and movements which tend 
to the betterment of the race and has long been a recognized leader in the 
temperance and religious work of the community. 

A native of Salem county, he was born in Maimington township, January 
13, 1836, his parents being William K. and Mary ('Tuft) Seagraves. The 
name is of English origin, and its first representative in America took up his 
abode in Cape May county. New Jersey, in early colonial days. During the 
progress of the Revolution the family was founded in Elsinboro township, 
Salem county, and its members have since been active factors in promoting 
the varied interests of the county along moral, educational and material 
lines. \\'illiam Seagraves, the grandfather, was a fanner of Mannington 
tow-nship, where he owned two hundred acres of land, a part of which is now 
in possession of our suljject. There he carried on agricultural pursuits until 
his death. He was a member and deacon in the Baptist church in Salem and 
took -a very active and zealous part in its work. One of his brothers, Samuel 
Seagraves, a very intelligent man, served as a captain in the war of 1812, 




J^. 




COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEIJ' JERSEY. 185 

and made his liome in ^lannington township. Wilham Seagraves was the 
father of two children, — Rebecca and \\'illiam K. The former, now deceased, 
became the wife of Wilham Lawrence, a farmer of Mannington township, 
and they had six children: William, Joseph, Edward, Susan, ]Mary and John. 

William K. Seagraves was born in Mannington township, in 1808, ob- 
tained a good English education, and became a surveyor. He followed that 
vocation throughout the greater part of his life and laid out many of the 
roads in this section of the county. He also engaged in school-teaching and 
in farming in Mannington township and subsequently removed to Lower 
Penn's Neck township, w'here he spent his last days upon a farm. He exer- 
cised his right of franchise in support of the Democratic party and held a 
number of local ofifices. the duties of which he discharged with promptness 
and fidelity. In the Baptist church of Salem he held a membership, served as 
one of its deacons, and aided largely in its work, doing all in his power for its 
growth and upbuilding. The cause of education also found in him a warm 
friend, and as trustee he did effective service in the interests of the schools. 
He died May 26, 1849, at the age of forty-one years, and his wife passed away 
in December, 1893, at the advanced age of eighty-two years. This worthy 
couple were the parents of seven children: Sarah married Dr. Scott Stewart, 
a very prominent physician of Philadelphia, who died and left the money for 
the erection of the Methodist hospital of that city. \Villiam K. began study- 
ing for the ministry, but died before completing the course. Robert T. is 
the third in order of birth. James M. engaged in the shipping business but 
is now deceased. George W. died at the age of sixteen years. Dr. Joseph 
S. was a graduate of the Jefferson Medical College and engaged in the prac- 
tice of medicine in Philadelphia up to the time of his death, which occurred 
wdien he was about thirty years of age. Dr. Clermont S., the youngest. 
was a graduate of Jeft'erson Medical College, and also studied medicine for 
a year in Edinburg, Scotland, but is now' deceased. 

In the district schools Robert T. Seagraves began his education, which 
was continued in the Salem Literary Institute. He began business when 
seventeen years of age, becoming identified with the agricultural interests of 
Lower Penn's Neck township in 1853. There he carried on farming until 
1883, and added to his property there until he had two hundred and twenty- 
five acres, which he placed under a high state of cultivation, the well-tilled 
fields yielding to him a golden tribute in return for the care and labor he 
bestow-ed upon them. In 1883 he removed to Salem and retired from active 
business, save the management of his landed possessions. In addition to the 
old homestead he has one hundred and twenty acres in Mannington town- 
ship, besides wooded land and other property in different sections of the 



i86 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

county. His diligence and capable management have brought to him a 
very desirable success in his business affairs, and having acquired a hand- 
some competence he is now enabled tO' live a retired life. He certainly de- 
serves great credit for what he has accomplished, for in his youth he not only 
had to provide for his own support, but was the mainstay of his mother and 
her family. His father died when he was quite young and in connection with 
his mother he managed and operated the home farm and provided for the 
education of the children, aiding them to become comfortabh' settled in life. 

Mr. Seagraves was married January 14. 1874, Miss Mary M. Gay becom- 
ing his wife. She is a daughter of Thomas Gay. of Boston, Massachusetts, 
and is a most estimable lady, who shares in the high regard in which her hus- 
band is uniformly held. 

Politically Mr. Seagraves is a Prohibitionist, and is a recognized leader 
in the temperance work in the county, teaching both by precept and example 
that abstinence is the best course. The cause of education finds in him a 
warm and zealous friend. He has served as a member of the board of trus- 
tees of the South Jersey Institute, at Bridgeton, filling that position for six- 
teen years. He contributed liberally to the support of the school and also per- 
sonally solicited funds. In 1891 he was appointed to raise an endowment 
fund and secured fifty-seven thousand dollars for that purpose, and when 
the work was successfully accomplished he resigned his position in 1892. 
He is a member of the board of trustees of the Xew Jersey Baptist state con- 
vention and treasurer of the Baptist Association of the State of New Jersey. 
For several years he has served as a deacon of the church of that denomina- 
tion in Saleii], and his labors l^a^•e been very effective in advancing its inter- 
ests. He is also the treasurer of the lioard of trustees of the Young Men's 
Christian Association and has always taken a very active interest in the work 
of that organization. He was one of the two gentlemen whose labors made 
possible the erection of their buildings at a cost of sixteen thousand dollars, 
his associate in this work being Caleb Wheeler. It would be almost tauto- 
logical to say that Mr. Seagraves is a man of broad humanitarian principles 
and marked sympathy, for this has been shadowed forth in the lines of this 
review. With a correct conception of the plans and purposes of life, he real- 
izes the importance of laying a firm foundation for character-building, and 
is therefore actively interested in assisting young men as they start out 
upon the journey of life where temptation and trials will frequently meet 
them. His kindly nature and genial manner win him the confidence and 
friendship of all, and Salem countv numbers him among her most esteemed 
citizens.

CHARLES WALTON. 

Charles Walton, ex-mayor of \\'oodbury. is one of the public-spirited bus- 
iness men of this beautiful city, and none are held in higher honor or more 
o-enerally esteemed. He is a worthy representative of a disting-uished En- 
glish family, four brothers of the name having come to America prior to the 
Revolutionary war. They settled near the Delaware river, not far from 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. George Walton, of this family, was one of the 
signers of the Declaration of Lidependence. 

Hiram Walton, the grandfather of our subject, was born in Philadelphia, 
learned the milling business in early life and followed that vocation thence- 
forth. He was the father of six children, namely: Mordecai, Mary, William, 
Abigail, Joseph and Rebecca. The latter, the only survivor of the family, 
was'born in 1810, and is a resident of the Quaker city, her home being at 
Xo. 459 North Fifth street. 

William Walton, father of Charles Walton, was born in Philadelphia in 
1 800 and passed his early manhood there. Coming to New Jersey about 
1840, he settled in Deptford township, Gloucester county, and eventually 
purchased a farm. He had been a miller in his native city, but during his 
last years he gave his attention solely to agriculture. He was in the United 
States army when a young man. but of this period of his life he preferred 
not to speak, as he was a member of the Society of Friends, and of course 
opposed, in principle, to war and aught but peace. His long and noble life 
came to a happy close September 15, 1883, but his memory is tenderly cher- 
ished in the hearts of scores of his old friends and associates. His wife, 
whose maiden name was Maria McKean, survived him a number of years, her 
death taking place in September, 1896. To this worthy couple twelve chil- 
dren were born, namely: Wilham, deceased: Hiram, of Philadelphia: Anna, 
the wife of Zaccheus Patterson, of Westville, Gloucester county. New Jersey: 
Charles: Henry, who died in infancy: Edward, of Chicago: Joseph, deceased; 
George, of Chicago: Mordecai, deceased: Morris, of Atlantic City, New 
Jersey, and John G. and Alfred C. twins, both residents of the Quaker City. 
Charles Walton, whose birth occurred in Deptford township, Gloucestej" 
county, February 13, 1853, was educated in the common schools of Wood- 
bury and at Pennington Seminary, in Mercer county. New Jersey. After 
completing his studies he was employed in various capacities for seventeen 
years, by Daniel Thackara, in Philadelphia, Woodbury and points in the 
south. In i88d he embarked in business on his own account, and for nearly 



i88 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

a score of years has Ijeen numbered among tlie leaders in \\"ood1iury's com- 
mercial circles. 

The high esteem in which Mr. Walton is held among our citizens may be 
judged, in part, by the fact that he has frecjuently been called upon to rep- 
resent them in the council. He ser\-ed as a member of that honorable body 
for two terms and for a like period held the important office of mayor of 
Woodbury. He is -a- member of the board of freeholders at present, and since 
the organization of tke health board he has been one of its most efficient 
workers. For six years he ofificiated as the assistant chief of the Woodbury 
volunteer fire department, and he is yet a member of the Friendship Com- 
pany. Politically, he is a stanch Republican, and religiously both he and his 
estimable wife are consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal church. 

The marriage of Mr. W'alton and Anna K. Warren took place in Wood- 
bury, August 9, 1887. Four children blessed their happy home, namely: 
Mary R., born June 16, 1888; Nellie, who was born July 9, 1889, and died 
in infancy; Gladys, born January 16, 1892; and Charles Wayne, August 29. 
1893. Mrs. W^alton is a daughter of Reuben and Mary K. (Kirkbride) War- 
ren, of Gloucester county, and was reared to womanhood in this section of 
the state. 



JULIUS WAY, M. D. 



The eminent ability of Dr. Julius Way has given him a standing in the 
medical profession that will entitle him to mention among the leading practi- 
tioners of Cape May Court House, where he has gained a large and lucrative 
patronage that many an older practitioner might well envy. His success rests 
upon a thorough and accurate knowledge of the principles of the medical 
science, of close application to the duties of his profession and upon a native 
ability that has enabled him to master the difficult problems which are con- 
tinually arising in connection with the profession upon which depends every 
other calling and labor in life, for health is an indispensable element in even' 
task that falls to the lot of man and is the foundation for all enjoyment and 
all progress. 

A nati\e of the Empire state. Dr. \\ ay was born in Kirkwood. Broome 
county, September 7, i860, his parents being Palmer M. and Amelia (Wil- 
son) Way. The Way family is of Scotch origin, and on the maternal side the 
Doctor is of Irish descent. Martin \\'ay, the great-grandfather, married a 
sister of Lord Stirling, and emigrated from Scotland to America, where his 
descendants have become very numerous. His son, Philemon \\'a\". was liorn 
in New York and spent his entire life in that state. He loyally served hi.~

country in the war of the Revolution and gave his political support first to 
the Whig party and aftenvard to the Republican party. Among his children 
was Palmer M. W'ay, who was born in Avon, Monroe county, New York, 
November 18, 1807, and there acquired his preliminary education in the com- 
mon schools. He was afterward a student in Hartwick Seminary, in Coopers- 
town, New York, and acquired an excellent knowledge of some of the ancient 
languages. Thus peculiarly well qualified for teaching, he devoted his ener- 
gies to that profession for a time. \Miile in the seminary he formed the 
acquaintance of J. Fenimore Cooper, the noted American novelist, and a 
friendship sprang up between them which endured until the death of Mr. 
Cooper. After two years spent as a teacher in Albany county. New York, 
Dr. Way continued his studies preparatory to entering Albany .\cademy, in 
which institution he was later graduated. He was afterward graduated in 
the Albany Medical College and then entered the Methodist ministry, offi- 
ciating for a time as the pastor of the \\'esleyan Methodist Episcopal church, 
in Albany. 

In 1 85 1 Dr. Way removed with his family to Jamaica, West Indies. 
whither he went as a medical missionary for the Congregational church, with 
which he became connected a short time l^efore leaving for the new field. 
For four years he remained in Jamaica and then returned to his native land, 
opening a drug store in New York city and also engaging in tlie practice of 
medicine there. For twelve years he remained in the Empire state, and 
in 1868 came to Cape May county. New Jersey, where he resided until his 
death. Here he engaged in the practice of medicine until 1865, when he 
turned over his business to his two sons: Dr. Eugene, a prominent physician 
and leading citizen of Cape May county; and Julius, of this review. In early 
life Dr. Palmer Way gave his political support to the Whig party, and on its 
dissolution joined the ranks of the Republican party, with which he afifiliated 
until the rise of the Greenback movement. He was identified with that or- 
ganization during its brief existence and then returned to the Repuljlican 
forces, exercising his right of franchise in support of its men and measures 
throughout the remainder of his life. At the time of his death he enjoyed 
the distinction of being the oldest Freemason in the state of New Jersey, 
having joined that order in 1828, when he was made a Master Mason in I\Iid- 
dlefield, Monroe county. New York, at the age of twenty-one years. At 
the time of his demise he was a member in good standing of Canon Lodge, 
No. 104, F. & A. M., in South Seaville, New Jersey, with which he had been 
connected for twenty-seven years. The Doctor was a man of fine physique, 
large and well proportioned, and had a rugged constitution. He passed 
the eighty-third milestone on life's journe}-, yet he had the appearance of

heing much younger and possessed the vigoi^ of a man scarcely past his prime. 
His was in many respects a remarkable career. He tra\eled all over the 
American continent, and was a witness of the remarkable growth and prog- 
ress made by the United States in the nineteenth century. 

Dr. Palmer Way married Amelia Wilson, and to them were born eight 
children: James P., the eldest, married Virginia Rice, by whom he had two 
children, — Maud and Edna, — and after her death he married Lizzie Thomp- 
son. He engaged in merchandising at Sea Isle City, and was the treasurer 
of that place, but died in 1892. Mary became the wife of Eugene C. Cole, a 
well known lawyer. Charles married Jennie C. Swan, and they have two 
children. — Mabel and Edna. He is a merchant of South Seaville, New Jer- 
sey, and has served as the postmaster there. Eugene wedded ]Mary Adams, 
and their children are Clarence. Jesse and Eannie. He is now a prominent 
practicing physician of Dennisville, Cape May county, is a member of the 
pension board and a trustee of the South Jersey Institute. Julius is the next 
of the family. George died at the age of twenty-two years. Albert married 
Lizzie Van Gilder, and their children were Liness, Emil and Benton. Their 
father has twice held the office of postmaster of Ocean View and is now en- 
gaged in merchandising there. Minnie, the youngest child, is a well known 
educator, for a while being a teacher in the Ocean View public school. 

We now take up the personal history of Dr. Julius Way, knowing that it 
will prove of interest to many of our readers, for he is both widely and favor- 
ably known in Cape May and adjoining counties. He attended the public 
schools of Seaville and subsequently was a student in the Philadelphia Col- 
lege of Pharmacy, in which institution he was graduated with the class of 
1882. He then matriculated in the Jefiferson Medical College and was gradu- 
ated in the class of 1885, after which he practiced for two years in South 
Seaville. In 1887 he came to Cape May Court House, where he has since 
remained. Few men are better cjualified for the practice of medicine than 
Dr. Way. He has taken a special course in chemistry, which together with 
his study in the medical and pharmacy schools has given him a broad and 
comprehensive knowledge of drugs and their uses. He is also conducting a 
drug store, and in both branches of his business is meeting with excellent 
success. He is a member of the Cape May County Medical Society and ha? 
gained a position of distinction in the ranks of the medical fraternity. He 
is also the physician for the board of health and the county physician for tlie 
almshouse and jail. 

In connection with his profession he has other interests, being interested 
in the New Jersey State Mutual Association and the Mechanics' & Laborers' 
Building & Loan Association. In 1892 he was elected a commissioner of 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEJV JERSEY. 191 

Cape May county. Socially he is connected with various civic organizations. 
He belongs to Hereford Lodge, I. O. O. F., Pomenah Tribe, O. R. M.. and 
the Ancient Order of United Workmen. He is also a member of the Meth- 
odist Episcopal church. The Doctor was elected, by the Republican party, 
the county clerk of Cape May county in the fall of 1899. taking the office 
February 27, 1900. In 1893 he was elected the coroner.of the county, on the 
same ticket, and served one term. 

In August, 1886, was celebrated the marriage of Dr. Way and },Iiss Ella 
Corson, a daughter of German Corson, and they now have two children, — 
Palmer M. and Helena. The Doctor and his wife occupy a very prominent 
position in social circles and enjoy the hospitality of many of the best homes 
in Cape May Court House. He is a man of broad humanitarian principles 
and deep sympathy, and on many untold occasions he has professionally 
visited those from whom he could hope to receive no remuneration. His 
honorable and upright life commends him to the confidence and regard of all, 
and no man is more highly esteemed in his adopted county than Dr. Juhus 
Way. 

SAMUEL H. SMITH. 

Captain S. H. Smith, a son of John and Sallie (Hendrickson) Smith, 
was born near Milford, in Kent county, Delaware, as were his father and 
grandfather, the parents of the latter being among the earliest settlers in 
Sussex county, Delaware. John Smith was a farmer of some pretensions in 
that state, not content to follow the beaten track of common usage in his 
chosen field of work, and in consequence was a benefactor to the farming 
community in that he introduced many new ideas that proved of great value. 
He was a Whig and later a Republican, as those parties came nearer to meet- 
ing his ideas of right. He was a member of the great Methodist church and

BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



March 22. 1894, in the ripeness of age and the conscionsness of a well spent 
life, deeply regretted by hosts of friends. 

Augustus S. Barber, Jr., received his education in the private schools of 
Woodbury and then entered the printing-office of his father, which afforded 
him a thorough course of training and enabled him to acquire a knowledge 
of the business. He was untiring in his eft'orts to keep the paper up to the 
high standard set for it and was useful to his father, who retired from the 
business in 1892, leaving the entire management to him. It is a clean, newsy 
sheet, neatly gotten up and ably edited, unwavering in its advocacy of the 
right and fearless in denouncing WTong. 

The marriage of Mr. Barber to Miss Hannah Maria Chattin, a daughter 
of \\'illiam P. and Arabella S. Chattin, was celebrated at Salem, New Jer- 
sey, the home of the bride, on Octolier 10, 1875, and they have had two 
children: William, who died in childhood; and John, born April 22, 1878. 
He is a member of the Presbyterian church and in politics a stanch Republi- 
can. He is a past master of Florence Lodge, No. 87, F. & A. M., and a past 
noble grand of Woodbury Lodge, No. 54, L O. O. F. He was elected to the 
office of county treasurer by the freeholders in 1896 and was re-elected in 
1898. He is the secretary' of the state executive committee, to which office 
he succeeded John Y. Foster, under Franklin Murphy, chairman, in 1898. 
He has filled the office of journal clerk of the state senate and is the present 
secretary of the senate. 



CHARLES HERITAGE. 

Charles Heritage, one of the leading farmers of East Greenwich town- 
ship, Gloucester county, was born on the 21st of November, 1830, in the 
township where he still resides, and is a son of Jonathan and Hannah (Atkin- 
son) Heritage. His paternal grandparents were Benjamin and Hannah (White) 
Heritage, natives of New Jersey and of English ancestry. Jonathan Heritage 
was born in Woolwich township, March 21, 1793, and in 1829 took up his res- 
idence upon the farm now occupied by his grandson. Walter, in East Green- 
wich township. There he made his home until his death, which occurred 
November 20, 1869. His wife, who was born in 1799, was called to her final 
rest on the 15th of February, 1871. Their children were: Charles: Benja- 
min, John and George, who reside in Mickleton: and Elizabeth, who makes 
her home with her brother Benjamin. 

Charles Heritage, whose name introduces this review, was educated in 
the Friends' school at Mickleton and assisted his father in the work of the 
home farm until 1854, when he purchased his present farm of one hundred 




^aJr ^eA^n 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEJV JERSEY. 195 

and twenty-three acres, and was actively connected with the cultivation of 
that property until 1886, since which time it has hem under the management 
of his son-in-law, Howard J. Rulon. 

On the 6th of April, 1854, ^Nlr. Heritage was united in marriage to Miss 
Martha R. Borton. a daughter of Aaron Borton, who resided in Salem 
county for many years and died near Mullica Hill, Gloucester county, in 
August, 1888. Eight children were horn to Mr. and Mrs. Heritage, as fol- 
lows: Walter and A11:)ert, who are well known residents of Gloucester county: 
Clara B., who died at the age of twenty-one years: John C. who carries on 
farming near Mickleton: Richard B.. a sheep farmer of Wyoming, who mar- 
ried Martha Boston, of Illinois, and has a son, \\'alter Raymond; Esther L., 
who is the wife of Howard J. Rulon, and has a daughter, Mary H.: Mary, 
who died at the age of three years: and Howard J., who died at the age of 
four years. 

Mr. Heritage and his family hold membership in the Society of Friends 
and are people of high respectability, enjoying the warm regard of all with 
whom they have have been brought in contact. Mr. Heritage is a charter 
member of the Mickleton Grange and served as its treasurer from 1893 until 
1898. In politics he is a stalwart Republican, ever earnest in the advocacy of 
the principles of the party, yet has never been an aspirant for the honors and 
emoluments of office. His time and attention have been given to his Imsi- 
ness afTairs, and his capability and unflagging industry Ijrought to him 
creditable success. He is now living retired, enjoying the fruits of his former 
toil. He takes a deep and abiding interest in everything pertaining to the 
welfare of Gloucester county and is justly accorded a place among her repre- 
sentative men. 



BRADWAY FAMILY. 



Edward Bradway, living in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, in London, 
transported himself, with his wife Mary and two children, Mary and Susanna 
Bradway and their three servants, — that is to say, William Groome. Francis 
Buckell and John Alim, — in the third month in the year, according to the 
English account, 1677, into America, on board ship Kent. Gregory Marloe 
master, who all arrived in the province of West New Jersey the seventh 
month following, and so to the place New Salem, where they did inhabit, and 
had the following children: Mary, Susanna (William not mentioned as 
coming with the family), Sarah (born the 27th of the seventh month, 1677). 
and Hannah, born the 14th of the seventh month, 1681. As the Kent was 
lea\ing the Thames, King Charles the 2<I, on his pleasure barge, came along-

side and asked whither tliey were g'oing, and on l^eing told they were 
Quakers going to America he gave them his blessing. 

Before coming to this country Edward Bradway purchased one thousand 
acres of land and a town lot of Fenwick, said lot containing sixteen acres, 
commencing near the public wharf at the creek and running up the street 
a certain distance, and from the line of said street a northerly course to Fen- 
wick creek. (See deed bearing date of June 6, 1680. Salem Surveys, book 
5, page 311, Trenton, N. J.) In the year 1691 Edward Bradw^ay built on 
his town lot a large brick house, which is still standing, for size and appear- 
ance surjiassing any house built prior to that date, and for many years after- 
ward in Salem. The governor of this state resided in this house some time 
after the death of Edward Bradway: hence it went under the name of the 
governor's house for many years afterward. It was also called the Light- 
house, because in earlier times lanterns were displayed from a pole on the 
roof to g-uide navigators in the creek. Edward and Mary Bradway deeded 
their house and town lot of sixteen acres to their daughter, Mary Cooper, 
a widow, the deed bearing date of January 16, 1693. (Salem Surveys, l^ook 
5, page 288. Trenton. N. J.) 

In 1693 the town of Salem was incorporated into a borough, and the 
authorities of the town changed the name of Wharf street to Bradway street, 
in honor of Edward Bradway. He was a prominent member of the Friends' 
meeting in early times, and appears in public aiifairs, being chosen a member 
of the assembly of Salem Tenth in September, 1685; signed concessions and 
agreement in March, 1676: was a member of assembly, Salem, in March, 
1683; justice of Salem Tenth in May, 1684; commissioned to call to account 
Salem people who had received public goods, in May, 1684; justice of Salem 
Tenth, in May, 1685; and member of the assembly, September, 1685. 

Edward Bradway's will, bearing date December, 1693, says: "To my 
wife Mary, all that tract of land I now live on, with house, orchaixl and all 
thereunto belonging, with the one hundred acres of marsh lying near the 
mouth of Monmouth river, — in all containing eight hundred acres, — for and 
during her natural life, and after her decease unto my daughters Susanna 
and Sarah, to be ecjually divided, and to m\^ wife ^^lary and daughters 
Susanna and Sarah each one-third of my personal estate; and unto my son 
William the tract of land he now lives on, containing five hundred acres. To 
my daughter Hannah, four hundred and fifty-nine acres of land called Stowe 
Neck. I give and bequeath to my grandson John Cooper, son of William 
Cooper, of Salem Town (deceased), three hundred acres of land, mentioned 
by deed."

William Cooper, of Pyne Poynt, and Mary Bradway. daughter of Edward 
Bradway, of AUoway's Creek, were married in Salem Meeting 9th mo., 8th, 
1682. William Cooper, Jr., lived l)ut a few years after his marriage, dying 3d 
mo., 1 69 1, in the thirty-first year of his age, leaving his wife Mary and three 
children — John, Hannah and Mary — to survive him. For so young a man 
he had acquired considerable property, consecjuently leaving, besides per- 
sonal property inx'entoried at £236 19s, his dwelling-house and sixteen acres 
■ of land in the town of Salem and eight hundred acres of land on AUoway's 
creek. Three hundred acres of the latter were given to him by his father-in- 
law, Edward Bradway, and these he devised to his son John; the remaining 
five hundred acres on AUoway's creek he purchased and devised them to his 
two daughters, Hannah and Mary. His dwelling-house and sixteen acres 
of ground he devised to his wife for life, "and after her decease to my unborn 
son or daughter, all unto him or her heirs forexer." There is little doubt that 
William Cooper, Jr., died at his father's house at Cooper's Point, his will being 
witnessed bv Sanniel Spicer and Henrv Wood, who lived near there. 

The children of W'illiam Coo]ier, Jr.. and Mary his wife were; John, born 
9th mo., 22d. 1683: Hannah, born 6th mo., jth, 1686, married John Mickle

married Benjamin Thackara in 1707; and Sarah, born 7th mo., 15th, 1691. 
John Cooper was not quite eight years old when his father died and soon be- 
came a member of his grandfather's family, for on 4th mo.. 5th, 1695, when 
in his twelfth year, this indenture of apprenticeship of that date was made; 

"^\'itnesseth that ye said John Cooper, by and with the consent of his 
mother and also of his own voluntary mind and will, hath put himself sarvant 
and after the manner of an apprentice unto ye sd. William Cooper, his said 
grandfather, to and with him to dwell from ye da}- of ye date hereof until he

mother, during the said tearme: and the said ^^'illiam Cooper is to find unto 
ye said John Cooper, his grandchild, sufficient and convenient meate, drinke, 
lodgeing, washing and apparill during ye sd tearme." 

He so won the confidence of his grandfather \Mlliam that he made liim. 
though but twenty-seven years old. one of his executors. 

On 1st mo., 5th. 1712-13, John Cooper married Ann Clark, oldest daugh- 
ter of Benjamin and Annie Clark. 

William and Margaret Cooper were English Friends. He was born in the 
year 1632, but neither the date of her birth nor the marriage is known. They 
lived at Coleshill, a hamlet in Hertfordshire, about twenty-nine miles north- 
west of London and not quite three miles from Jordan's, the burial place of 
Penn. It has a population of about six hundred and from its elevated posi- 
tion commands a view of six counties, while the beautifully wooded hills in its 
vicinity are celebrated. There they became convinced of the truth preached 
by George Fox and thence emigrated to America in the year 1679, bringing 
with them their five children, — William, Hannah, Joseph, James and Daniel. 
They attended in England the Friends" Meetings held at Thomas Elwood's 
house one mile from Coleshill, and at Isaac Pennington's not three miles dis- 
tant, and were members of Upperside Meeting of Friends, from which they 
received the following certificate: 

"Whereas, ^^■illiam Cooper, of Coleshill, in ye ])'rsh of Amersham and 
ye County of Hertford, hath signified unto us that he hath an intention if ye 
Lords permit to transport himself with his wife and children unto ye planta- 
tion of West New Jersey, and hath desired a testimonial from this Meeting 
for ye satisfaction of Friends there or elsewhere unto whom he may be out- 
wardly unknown." 

William Cooper located a survey of eighty acres '"within the town bounds 
of Burlington," the return of the survey being dated October, i. 1680. In 
the spring of 1681 they determined to move further down the river and 
selected the highland at the mouth of Asoroches river, the Indian name for 
Cooper's Creek, where a dense pine forest then grew, from which William 
Cooper named the place, Pyne Poynte. Here William Cooper located three 
hundred acres of land, comprising the greater part of the present First and 
Second wards of the city of Camden, considerable parts of which still (in 
1896) belong to his descendants, in the direct line, who hold their title by 
descent and devise, without a deed having been made since the first location 
of the land. He built his house near the edge of the bluff, on a site long 
since washed into the river by the inroads of the tide. Upon this tract a tribe 
of Indians, whose chief was Arasapha. had a village and kept up a constant 
intercourse by canoes with the opposite Indian village of Shackamaxon. 



200 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Recognizing their right to the soil, WiUiam Cooper purcliased it from them 
also, and received from them a deed signed by Talacca. their resident chief, 
and witnessed by several of their tribe. 

William Kenton and Mary Cooper were married nth mo., 30th, 1692. 
He lived but a short time after marriage. In his will, bearing date 8th day of 
December, 1693, recorded 23d of April, 1694, is the following: 

"Late of the province of Maryland, now of Salem Towne, I will my 
Estate, viz., lands, Goods & Chattels belonging unto me in the province of 
Maryland, to be sold for the payment of my debts. I give and bequeath 
unto my 2 sons William and John Kenton all that tract of land and plantation 
lately purchased ol John Worledge when they attain the age of one & twenty 
years. To my wife Mary Kenton, the rest and residue of my estate, both real 
& personal. I appoint my wife Mary and friend Richard Darkin, of Salem 
Co., and John Pitts of Maryland, to be my executors." 

Hugh Middleton and Mary Kenton were married October 26. 1694. 
He was a resident of Mannington. His will, bearing date January 19, 1713, 
mentions his son John, daughter Mary, and daughter-in-law Sarah Hurley. 
It contains the following provisions: "To my son I give that plantation or 
farm whereon I now dwell called Bariton Fields, containing eight hundred 
acres of land. To my daughter Mary Middleton, one hundred and fourteen 
acres of land lying on the north side of Halltown creek, adjoining the land 
of John Pledger, of whom the land was formerly bought, together with ye 
half part of a gristmill now erecting upon ye premises in partnership between 
myself and John Van Mater. To my daughter Mary I give my silver tankard, 
also one feather bed, clothes, curtains, and other furniture thereonto belong- 
ings being in ye great roome of my dwelling-house." 

Hugh Middleton's grandson John Vining was the chief justice of the 
state of Delaware and speaker of the Delaware house of assembly. He died 
in the Middleton house in Mannington and was borne by pall-bearers on foot 
four miles to Salem and buried in the aisle of St. John's Episcopal church. 
His tombstone and that of his father were taken up of late years and now are 
built into the front wall of the church. His personal property was in- 
ventoried at five hundred and seventy-two pounds. He was elected the sheriff 
of Salem county in 1696, 1697, 1699, and elected justice in 1701. Hugh Mid- 
dleton's father was from Leicestershire and his mother from Gloucestershire, 
England. The Vining family came from Essex county, Massachusetts. Sarah 
Hurley, daughter-in-law of Hugh Middleton, married Joseph Pledger. 

From the emigrant's grandson Edward is descended Aaron Bradway, of 
Elsinboro. In his will, bearing date November nth, 1774, he says: "To 
my son Joshua I give the jMantation I now live on, with all the house and 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY 201 

buildings thereunto belonging; but if my son Joshua should die before he has 
lawful issue, then my will is that the said plantation be divided between my 
two sons Aaron and Edward Bradway (by the meeting of Friends). To my 
grandchildren Mary and Tacy Goodwin, and my daughter Rebecca Good- 
win, and my two daughters Sarah and Hannah, sixty pounds proclamation 
money; and to my son Thomas one hundred and fifty pounds proclamation 
money; and to my sons Edward, Aaron and Thomas, my house and lots in 
Salem; also woodlands, etc. My wife Sarah, executrix." 

Thomas Bradway's mother was Sarah Smith, the second wife of Aaron. 
Joshua, the first son of Aaron Bradway, mentions in his will, bearing date 
October i6th, 1807: "My will is that one thousand pounds be put to interest, 
said interest to be paid annually to my niece Hannah Goodwin during her 
life, and after her death, the said one thousand pounds to the surviving chil- 
dren of my half-brother Edward Bradway, and to the chiltlren of my half- 
sister Hannah Bradway, now deceased, and to the children of half-sister 
Sarah Waddington; and all said children to have equal shares except my 
half-sister Hannah's son Joshua is to have as much as any two of the others. 
Secondly, I give Grace Bradway, daughter of Edward Bradway, two hundred 
pounds, which is in addition to her share of the thousand pounds aljove or- 
dered. I devise to my half-brother Thomas Bradway my two houses and 
lots in the town of Salem and a wood lot in Upper Alloway's Creek. I also

EHzabeth Black, three hundred pounds; to Prudence, the daughter of Rich- 
ard Smith, fifty pounds; to James Bartram, twenty-five pounds; to Daniel

HARRIS FA^HLY 



The Harris familv is a numerous and influential one Loth in Cumberland 
and Salem counties.' Two brothers, by the name of Samuel and Thomas, 
emi-rated from Wales about the beginning of the eighteenth century, land- 
in- "at Long Island, where their stay was of short duration. Hearmg there 
w^s a large emigration from the states of New York and Connecticut, they 
concluded thev would emigrate to South Jersey, and came to Cohansey pre- 
cinct, where they purchased land and settled. ^lany of their descendants 
are residents of Cumberland county at the present time. 

\braham Harris, a son of Samuel, purchased one hundred and fifty acres 
of land in Allowav's Creek township, being part of John Chandler's allot- 
ment. The said land was bounded on the west by Annie Salter's ten-thousand- 
acre tract of land. The point where Abraham Harris built and lived was on 
the place known at the present time as the Johnson-Harris farm. The^land 
extended up to the road that leads from Ouinton's Bridge to Wood's Upper 
Ylill \braham Harris, after he had purchased the aforesaid land, built him- 
self a log house and married Esther Langly. They had six sons and one 
dauo-hter whose names were: Abraham, born 174^; Isaac. 1748: Jacob, 
1 75 1 : John, 1753; Permanus. 1755: Nicholas. 1757: and Sophia Harris, about 
1760. Abraham Harris, the father of the above children, died in 1777. aged 
al)out f^fty-three: his widow survived him a few years. After the death of ^ 
AbrahamHarris, Sr., the land was divided among his children. 

Abraham, the eldest son of Abraham and Esther Harris, married Keren- 
happuch Blackwood in 1776. (The Blackwoods came from Scotland.) He 
built himself a dwelling-house near the Mill road on his share of his father's 
land and at that place he ended his days, after reaching the great age of 
ninety-three years and ten months. He was long a member of the Baptist 
church of Salem and a consistent Christian, having been baptized before he 
was twenty years of age. and was one of the deacons of said church for many 
years. He "frequently walked to Salem meeting, a distance of seven miles, 
after he was over ninety years of age. He was an ardent Whig at the time 
of the Revolution and volunteered as a militiaman under Colonels Hand and 
Holme. Abraham and his wife Kerenhappnch Harris had four children, — 
Dalvmore. Elizabeth. Samuel and :\Iargaret Harris. Dalymore, the eldest

grandson of Benjamin Acton, the eminent surveyor of Salem. Dalymore 
and his wife Letitia Harris had seven children who lived to grow up, married 
and had families. Their names were Josiah, Ephraim, 'Mar\- Ann, Samuel, 
Dalymore, Elizabeth and Parmenus Harris. Josiah. the eldest, resided the 
most of his Hfe after he arrived at manhood in Upper Penn's Neck. He mar- 
ried Sarah Johnson, of Penn's Grove, and had si.x children, whose names are 
]\lary, James, \\'illiam, Edward. Kate and Annie. Josiah, their father, has 
been deceased for a number of years. Ephraim, the second son of Dalymore 
and Letitia Harris was a blacksmith by trade. He married Catherine Bal- 
lenger. Her father resided near Ouinton's Bridge. Some time after mar- 
riage he abandoned his trade and purchased a farm near the village and went 
to farming and continued in that calling until his death. They had one son. 
Josiah Harris, who resides where his parents lived. Lie married the daughter 
of William Robinson. 

Mary Ann. the daughter of Dalymore and Letitia Harris, married William 
Morrison and had six children, — Letitia, George R., Anna, Susan, Charles 
and Mary Ann. Mary Ann. the mother, died when her children were minors: 
consequently the care and responsibility of their education and moral training- 
devolved principally upon her daughter Letitia. Anna, the second daughter, 
died a few years after her mother. George R. Morrison married Sarah Jane, 
a daughter of William and Rebecca Plummer, and they have five children, — 
Thomas, Harry, Anna, Mary and George Morrison, Jr. George R. Morrison, 
now deceased, was the surrogate of Salem county for many years. Mary 
Ann died of consumption. Letitia and Susan are also^ deceased. William 
Morrison, the father of the above-mentioned children, abandoned the mer- 
cantile business at Hancock's Bridge and purchased property in Elsinboro 
near Salem. He has been deceased for many years. Samuel, a son of Daly- 
more and Letitia Harris, was a house carpenter by trade. After he became of 
age he resided at Cape May Court House and married Mar}- Foster. They

ter of Dalymore and Letitia Harris, married George Clark, and they have 
two children, — William and Mary Clark. William married Emma Cobb and 
had one son, Charles. Mary married Charles Fennimore and has one son,

dowed with uncommon memory, he was an extensive reader both of ancient 
and modern historv. particularly English history and that o his own countiy.

Ellis Simpkins and died in early life, leaving several children. Samuel, a son 
of \braham, never married, and died aged eighty-two years. Margaret, a 
daughter of Abraham, never married, lived to old age, and after her mother s 
death took charge of her father's house.

industrious man. When voung he became a member of the Baptist societ> . 
He married Marv Young, by whom he had nine sons, four of whom srirvived 
him The names of those were James. Joseph. Mason and Johnson Harris. 
Isaac took an active part in the Revolution, belonging to the mihtia; was at 
the battle of Ouinton's Bridge, when the Americans were pursued by the 
English soldie7s. and to save his life he swam Alloway's creek. Altho^ugh he 
was shot at several times he escaped free of wounds' He died the f^fth o 
\pril 1814. of tvphus fever, which was then raging in this county to a fearful 
extent. His age was about sixty-five years. James, the son of Isaac, was

William, James and Mary. Caleb Stackhouse was a descendant of Thomas 
Stackhouse, the emigrant and provincial counselor of Penn.

a daughter of Elijah Fogg. She died young, leaving one daughter, who 
married James Robinson. Isaac's second wife was Martha Abbott, the widow 
of William Abbott. Her maiden name was Reeves, and she was of Cumber- 
land county. By that marriage there were three children,— Sarah, William 
and Martha Harris. Sarah, a daughter of Isaac and Martha Harris, married 
Tob Stretch. Jr. She is deceased, leaving five children.— Rosanna, Harry,

and lived to old age. He and his family went to the state of Ohio in 1807. 
His children's names were Elisha. Isaac, Sarah, Hannah, So]>hia, Achsah and 
Rebecca Harris. 

John, the fourth son of Abraham and Esther Langly Harris, was born 
October 10, 1753. His life was an eventful one. He was about twenty-two 
years old when the war of the Revolution connnenced. He A\ent first in 
1776, in the militia of Flying Camp, as it was then called, for six months; 
was in the army under Washington, which assembled at New York for the 
defense of that city, and was also in the battle of Long Island, the 27th of 
August of that year. That fall or winter he was sick at Somerset, in this 
state, and came home when his six months were out. The next spring he 
enlisted in the regular army for seven years or during the war, as a bombadier 
in the Pennsylvania Artillery, Continental line: also drum major, and joined 
the main army under Washington and was in the battle of the Brandywine, 
at Germantown and at Valley Forge while the British army had comfortable 
quarters at Philadelphia. In the summer of 1778 he went with General Sulli- 
van on an expedition against the Indians up the Susquehanna. .Vfter that 
he was sent with a part of the army to Pittsburg, then called Fort Pitt, w here 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT Of NEW fERSEY. 217 

he continued during tlie remainder of the war. Hugh Blackwood accom- 
panied him through tlie flying camp and regular army, and they returned 
home together. 

Following is in substance his account of his experience in army life: 

"At the battle of Germantown we planted our cannon at the gate before 
Chew's house, — by the stone gate-posts, which are there now. Just inside 
the gate lay six British grenadiers dead. We were ordered to fire grape-shot. 
After we fired awhile it seemed as if we were not making as much impression 
as. we ought; and as the fog was so thick we could not see very much, one of 
our ofificers rode up to the house where the British were, and when he came 
back he said, 'Boys, use cannon ball: it is a stone house;' but the fog lifted 
pretty soon, and as there were but a few of us we had to retreat. If we had 
knownitwasa stone house when we first commenced we would have knocked 
it to pieces, likely. The old shot shows to this day. The shutters are patched, 
and one shot went through it to the kitchen. 

"I was in a great many skirmishes around Philadelphia while the British 
had it in possession. As they would send out foraging parties around it the 
Americans would send out parties to capture them. It was late in the fall and 
we often had the Schuylkill river to wade. The officers would order us to 
hold up our ammunition to keep it dry. As I belonged to the artillery I 
generally rode over on my gun. One of those nights I thought my 
time was about to come. The English heard of our being after them 
and threw up intrenchments across a road in the wood; and as they had 
cannon it was expected, of course, that they would plant some to sweep the 
road; and as my gun came in the road as we marched up in order of battle 
expecting them to fire, I could see their camp fires blazing high. But the 
Americans kept marching up, marching up; but they did not open their bat- 
teries. At last an officer rode up and looked over the breast-works. When he 
came back he said, 'Damn them! They have given up the bag: have left e\ery- 
thing there to deceive us, — even their supper cooking!' But the officer would 
not let us eat it, hungry as we were, for fear of poison. 

"On the nth of September, 1777, the battle of Brandywine was fought. 
I was in that, and wintered at Valley Forge, 1777-8, with Washington: was 
starved and frozen. A soldier's life was worse than a dog's. The saying is. 
'A dog's life is hunger and ease;' a soldier's was hunger and hardships." 

It is thought that Mr. HaiTis was also in the battle of Monmouth, the 
28th day of June, 1778. Soldiers in both armies died from heat and want 
of water. They fared badly also for clothing, their shirts would be all gone 
except wristbands and collars. Horse beef, and it was often spoiled, they 



2i8 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

had for meals. Resuming the narrative of Mr. Harris, within quotation 
points, we proceed: 

"In the fall of 1779 I was with General Sullivan up the Susquehanna to 
destroy the Indians" corn. As thev were partlv civilized and farmed a good 
bit. it was thought that they had an extra amount planted to feed Burgoyne's 
army, that was expected to come from Canada down that way; and also to 
retaliate for the massacre of Wyoming. But General Gates defeated Bur- 
goyne at Saratoga, New York. It was splendid corn, aliout forward enough 
for roasting or boiling, when we cut it up and set fire to their wigwams. It 
ruined them and they never recovered from the blow. 

"A part of the army. I among them, was sent across the mountains to 
Fort Pitt, now Pittsburg. What route we went I cannot tell. There was 
not even a wagon road further than Gettysburg. We got our supplies from 
there by pack-mules, as we would start a train when the path was reported 
clear of Indians. They could run almost equal to a deer or lie flat as a rabbit 
and hide where there was almost nothing. I did not admire the Indians' 
character. They would lie and steal anything they could lay their hands on. 
^\'e had a great many skirmishes with them, but not much we could call a 
battle. Their w-arfare was to get behind trees and shoot from cover. In one 
of our skirmishes I was not feeling very good and an Irishman said to me, 
"Braize up, Harris: this day a golden chain or a wooden leg." I told him I 
thought the prospect for a golden chain was not very bright, fighting Indians, 
when they could carry all they had on their l;acks and run with it. 

"I went with General Sullivan in the fall of 1779 west of the Allegliany 
mountains. I ne\-er got back or heard from home during the war, but was 
in the neighborhood of Pittsburg most of the time. We made an expedition 
down the Ohio river. That was the hardest campaign of all. It was not very 
much work to go down with the current, as we were in a flat-boat of some 
kind, with oars to row it. It was reported that a settlement of white people 
was along the river on the Ohio side at one place, perhaps Marietta; but we 
did not know certainly. We were in two divisions and I was in the first; and 
our ofificers ordered every one to be ready with his finger on the trigger, and 
so we drifted by, never seeing any one. The other party, carelessly thinking 
the advance had stopped, rowed up to the shore and the Indians sprang out 
and killed and took every man! ^^'e heard the reason the Indians did not 
attack us: they thought we were only a small advance party and they felt 
able for the main body and expected our general was in the rear; and as he 
had a red head they wanted his scalp particularly; but they were deceived in 
that; and if they had attacked us they would have met with a warm recep- 
tion. 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEJV JERSEY. 219 

"We went as far as Louisville, then called the Great Falls, but were not 
there but a short time before we were ordered back to Pittsburg, just at the 
setting in of winter, and the river low and full of ripples. We would have to 
jump out and push our boats over and then get in and row, sitting with wet 
clothing on and almost freezing. As we went down one of our number died, 
and we had no shovels to bury him. We placed him in a hollow in the ground 
made by the l)lowing down of a tree, and put what dirt we could on him: but 
as we came liack we saw that the wolves had dug him out and picked his 
bones ! 

"We would stay out in the middle of the river all day pulling up till, to- 
ward night, we would work in shore and land a party to scour the woods for 
Indians and post our sentinels around, and camp for the night. The wolves 
would come up around the sentinels and howl and appear as if not farther off 
than the length of our guns; but we dared not shoot them: it would be giv- 
ing a false alarm. We also had another thing to contend with, worse than 
any I have mentioned. — hunger: we came very near starving. There was 
a settlement at Wheeling. West Virginia, and a temporary mill that would 
grind corn, which was run by man power. So we made great calculations 
when we reached there: but pretty soon after we got to work the soldiers 
got hold of some whisky and got so drunk that they could not work, got 
nothing done and we came nearer starving than before! 

"Pittsljurg was a hundred miles yet before us. We were working up the 
Ohio. In one canoe was a sick Irishman and the current catched and upset 
it. ^^'e lamented his fate, supposing he was drowned, of course: Init when 
we came to turn up the canoe there he was in it. not any the worse. — only 
wet! Some one asked him if he could take a little whisky. He said. 'By the 
Lord! try me." 

"During the winter of 1777-8. at Valley Forge, we were so badly off for 
clothing one could track the soldiers over the frozen ground by the blood 
from their bare feet! and no blankets! would lie down around our camp fire 
to sleep and our hair would freeze fast to the ground! 

"We finally arrivetl at Pittsburg, a poor place then. — not even a frame 
house in it. There was a line of soldiers' barracks, or frame-work. There 
were several log houses, with a quarter of an acre of ground attached, which 
formed the citv at that time. There was no road across the mountains, and 
from Gettysburg to Pittsburg everything was carried by pack-mules. Not 
much there but whisky, and it would take a month's wages to Iniy a gill 
with the money we were paid with! About eighty dollars good money would 
buy a quarter of an acre of ground with a log house on it then, but I would not

have had one even for a gift if I had to stay there: it was siicli a poor place. 
and I thought always would be." 

Mr. Harris was discharged at that place, on the 30th of September. 1783. 
William Irving, brigadier general, in command. His discharge is still in the 
family. His pay for the last two or three years was the continental money 
that \\as issued by congress. He was in seven generaJ battles, including 
that at Flatbush, Long Island, August 27, 1776. besides many skirmishes, 
but was never wounded: was once, however, knocked down by a spent ball. 
He came home poor and for a year or two was in very ])Oor health, his con- 
stitution much impaired by exposure while in the anu}-. being afflicted 
with chills and fever. In after life his companv was much sought, and he. 
having a retentive memory, would interest his friends by relating incidents 
and occurrences he had experienced while in the army. 

In 1785 he married Lydia, a daughter of Captain William Smith, of the 
militia in the battle of Quinton's Bridge, who had some of his hair shot awa\- 
from the back part of his head! a bullet grazed his loins, and his horse re- 
ceived two bullets in him; yet he carried his rider safely over the bridge and

\\'ith some exceptions, which but prove the rule, it is found that success 
in an\' line of human endeavor is the sure reward of the man with keen, alert 
brain, concentrated will power and persistence in a course of action once de- 
cided upon. How often, in reviewing the lives of men, are we reminded of 
the wise saying of the great dramatist and poet, "There is a tide in the affairs 
of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;" and the ability to 
grasp an opportunity for advancement, the good judgment and foresight 
which measures the end desired, at the beginning, are characteristics of every 
successful man. 

Horace S. X'anleer, a prominent citizen of Allowav. Salem count}', was 
born in Deerfield township, Cumberland county. New Jersey, May 20, 1850. 
His parents, Isaac and Susanna (Hitchner) \'anleer, are represented in the 
sketch of his brotlier, John H. \'^anleer, which appears elsewhere in this vol- 
ume. Our subject received a good general education in the schools of his 
o\vn neighborhood and for a period of four years he was employed as a clerk 
by Smith Rempster, of Alloway. During that time he mastered the prin- 
ciples of business, and, having carefully husbanded his resources, then bought 
out his late employer and for the ensuing twenty-one years Successfully car- 
ried on a mercantile business. In March, 1898, he disposed of his stock of 
goods and turned his entire attention to the various other enterprises which 
have gradually claimed more and more of his time and energy. In 1890 he 
established the Alloway Creamery, buying the property of Richard Stretch, 
and since then he has conducted a profitable and increasing business in butter 
and ice-cream. In addition to this he owns and operates a factory at Mill- 
ville. New Jersey. By strict attention to the wishes of his customers and by 
the superior excellence of the products of his factories, he has built up a large 
and remunerati\e trade. His New Process Salem County ice-cream finds a 
readier sale than any other product of the kind in southern New Jersey, and 
large shipments are made to the various seaside resorts. Upward of one

hundred cans of milk are daily supplied to customers by ^Ir. Vanleer's cream- 
eries an<l he has contracts with creameries in Delaware as well as m this 
state". He attends to his own Iniying and selling, and employs seven or more 
persons regularly. His expressage of ice-cream amounts to five thousand 
dollars a season and his trade is growing at an amazing rate each year. He 
owned and operated the first automobile in south Jersey. He is extremely 
active and industrious, making friends of his customers by supplying them 
with wholesome, delicious cream, uniformly excellent and appetizing. 

Though he uses his franchise on behalf of the I3emocratic party, Mr. \ an- 
leer is not an aspirant to public office and keeps out of politics. Fraternally 
he is identified with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. His marriage 
to Miss Julia A. Rempster, a daughter of his former employer. Smith Remp- 
ster, took place February 19. i874- They became the parents of a bright, 
promising little son. Chester, who died when four years of age.

Salem county. The good wife departed this life in 18^7. Of their eleven 
children, our subject is the only survivor.

Jersey, and remained with him for five years. Upon the l)reaking out of 
the civil war. he eiihsted in the Tliird Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery, and did 
hospital duty until 1865. After his return from the army he attended medi- 
cal lectures in Philadelphia, at the Eclectic College, graduating in 1866, after 
which he hegan the practice of his chosen profession at Palatine, continuing 
until he retired, in 1893. on account of illness. His practice was over an 
extended scope of country and was very large. Besides other property, the 
Doctor has a fine fifty-acre farm. 

April II. 1830. he was married to Phoel)e Van Meter, the daughter of 
Mr. and ]\Irs. Da\-id Van Meter, by whom three children were 1)orn: Ruth 
Ann. single; Charles S.. at home; and Frank T.. in Philadelphia, Pennsyl- 
vania. Dr. Atkinson was \'ery active in the temperance mo\'ement, and was 
at one time the president of the State Farmers' Alliance. Among other 
places of trust he has held, was the chairmanship of the county executive 
committee of his party, for the period from 1878 to 1885. He was a candi- 
date for the state assembly in 1878, and for congress in 1880, on the Green- 
back ticket. He was a strong supporter of ^\'illiam Jennings Bryan for presi- 
dent in 1896. He has been identified with the Methodist church since he 
was sixteen years of age and has frequently held the offices of trustee and 
class-leader in this organization. The greatest obstacle our subject has had 
to overcome in his career has been the lack of good health, at times unfitting 
him for the discharge of his duty as a public and professional man. But, 
notwithstanding this, he has. by being cautious, been able to do a vast 
amount of such work, for which his patrons owe him their gratitude and in 
many cases even their lives. 



JEREMIAH P. DELANEY. 

This gentleman is the superintendent of the water-works at Sea Isle City, 
and is one of the leading and representative men of that. town. He was born 
in New York city. Aug^ist 18, 1859. a son of Jeremiah and Eliza (Redding) 
Delaney. His father was a native of county Cork, Ireland, and during h.is 
boyhood crossed the Atlantic, locating in New York. He became a brick- 
layer, and was employed on a number of public works in the metropolis, 
including the gas system. His political support was given the Democracy. 
He was a member of the Mncent de Paul Society, of New York, and of the 
Catholic church. During the civil war he manifested his loyalty to the Union 
by joining the Sixty-ninth New York Regiment, and upon the battle-fields 
of the south he aided in the defense of the stars and stripes and the cause

it represented. He had six sons, namely: John, deceased; Jeremiah Paul. 
William John Thomas and Michael. The father of these children was called 
to his f^nal rest at the age of forty-two years, and the mother is still livmg. 
at the age of fifty-eight years. • 

Jeremiah Paul Delanev was educated in the public schools of New \ ork 
city" and Philadelphia, pursuing his studies until thirteen years of age. \A hen 
a lad of eight he removed to the latter place, and on putting aside his text- 
books he secured a position with the Home Sewing Machine Company 
there. He afterward learned the stone-cutter's trade, but not findmg it en- 
tirely congenial he learned the plasterer's trade, and since 1883 he has been 
the leading contractor in that line of business in Sea Isle City. In 1886 he 
erected the Olympic Hotel, on Landis avenue, having accommodation for 
forty guests. He is also dealing in coal and wood, and in addition to his 
hotel he owns a number of building lots at this place. In 1896 he was made 
superintendent of the Sea Isle water-works.and has since held that position, 
discharging his duties with ability and ef^ciency. 

Mr.^Delanev has been a very important factor in the development of Sea 
Isle City and in the promotion of the various interests and enterprises which 
contribute to its upbuilding and progress. He organized the volunteer fire 
companv No. i. in December. 1896. was elected its chief, and has since filled 
that position. He was the founder of the fire department here, and built 
the engine house which it now occupies. There is now a membership of 
ei-hteen and the department is well equipped with hose-cart and hook-and- 
ladder apparatus. For three years, however, the members of the department 
supported it entirelv. For five terms Mr. Delaney has been a member of 
the citv council, and at all times gave his support to the measures which he 
believed would prove a public benefit. He is now a long-term member of 
that council. In 1896 he served as a doorkeeper in the legislature. For 
three years he was a notary public. In all these various public offices he has 
faithfully discharged every trust reposed in him. and whether in or out of 
ofiice he is loyal to the welfare of his adopted country. 

Mr. Delaney holds the papers that will substantiate the following state- 
ments concerning his political career: 

Under President Cleveland's second administration he was appointed the 
postmaster of Sea Isle City; but after a desperate fight lasting about thirteen 
months he was not confirmed, but had the option, from United States Sena- 
tor James Smith, Jr., of allowing the Republican postmaster to hold over, or 
he would continue the fight and allow no change. He said, "No: if I cannot 
make it let some other Democrat have it." But Senator Smith said to him, 
•Tf you want to draw out of the contest I will fix you in a better position, as 



232 



BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



you richly deserve." Accordingly Dr. Delaney withdrew from the contest 
for the postmastership. 

Senator Smith, to whom the Cleveland administration had allotted sev- 
eral appointments in the Philadelphia mint, had to go to Europe, and these 
appointments he left in charge of William J. Thompson, of Gloucester, with 
the distinct understanding that Mr. Delaney should ha\e the first choice: 
but Mr. Thompson, a close personal friend of Mr. Delaney, knowing that he 
did not care for the job, gave it to a near friend of his, unawares to Senator 
Smith, who on his return from Europe was greatly displeased. After all. 
the political enemies of Mr. Delaney of that period are now his personal 
friends. 

In 1883 occurred the marriage of Mr. Delaney and Miss Mary Dever. 
Their union has been blessed with six children: Mazie, Jeremiah. Thomas. 
Anna, Lizzie and James. The last named is now deceased. The parents 
are members of the Catholic church, and have reared their family in that 
faith. Mr. Delaney belongs to the class of self-made men who are the 
strength of our American repulilic. Their own efforts to gain a livelihood 
and work their way upward to positions of afHuence make them desirous of 
aiding others who are forced to travel the same difficult road to success. 



JOHN F. NUTE & CO:\IPANY. 

John F. Nute, the senior partner in one of the most flourishing mercantile 
establishments in Franklinville, Gloucester county, New Jersey, is a native 
of Lincoln, Maine, where he was born June 4, 1819. His immediate ances- 
tors were Israel and Hannah (Fish) Nute, while his grandfather was Jotham 
Nute, a descendant of James Nute, who came from England in 1631 and 
located at Dover, New Hampshire. Jotham Nute was filled with patriotic 
ardor and became a soldier in the Rebellion, although he was a lad in his 
'teens at the time. He later became one of the most prominent men con- 
nected with the history of New Hampshire during his life-time. One of his 
sons, Levi H., was a cadet at West Point and stood high in the records of 
that institution, outranking General Taylor. He was a soldier in the !\Iexi- 
can w'ar. 

Israel Nute learnefl the trade of carpenter and followed that business for 
many years in Great Falls, when failing health obliged him to seek other 
employment, and he chose agricultural pursuits as being at once healthful 
and remunerative. He was elected to the ofifice of justice of the peace, a 
position he held for many years, discharging the duties of the ofifice in a

manner which ehcited the commendation of all. The maiden name of his 
wife was Hannah Fish. She was a daughter of John Fish and came from 
the state of Vermont. Six children were the fruits of this union, three of 
whom are living, namely: J. F., our subject: Frederick E.. a resident of Lin- 
coln, Maine; and George H., of Easton. Pennsylvania. The family were 
reared in conformity to the teachings of the Congregational church, of 
which Israel Xute was a consistent member: and his death, w hich occurred in 
1836, was sincerely regretted by a large circle of friends. 

J. F. Nute acquired his education under difificulties little known by the 
present generation. The school which he attended was located a distance of 
a mile and one-half from the paternal home and was of the most primitive 
construction, while the books of that time, furnished even for primary schol- 
ars, would be difficult for a much older pupil of this age, so dense was the 
conception of the texts. However, the environment appears to have had 
but little to do with the development of the intellect, as many of the most 
brilliant men our country has ever known or will know received their training 
in the old school-house with puncheon floor and slab seats. At the age of 
seventeen years our subject entered the store of his uncle, Jacob Fish, at 
Lincoln, Maine, where he remained seven years and developed an aptitude 
for the mercantile business, which induced him to start in trade for himself. 
This he did in the same village and soon had built up a large and paying 
business. He continued this store for twenty-one years. In the fall of 1865 
he moved to Franklinville, New Jersey, and with his brother George H. built 
a store, where they were in trade until 1879; and then George A. Nute ad- 
mitted his uncle, George H. Nute, in the business. The store was burned 
in July, 1880, and in 1885 the Messrs. Nute erected the store building where 
they now conduct their business. 

John F. Nute was married December 24, 1849. to Alary Allen Lovejoy. 
a daughter of John Lovejoy, who was a resident of the state of Maine and a 
prominent man in his community. Four children blessed their marriage: 
Ruel L., connected with his father in business and enumerator in the L'nited 
States census of 1900, and a dealer in agricultural implements; George .\., 
whose biography follows; Ira E.. a resident of St. Louis; and Mary A., the 
wife of Edward Sanborn, of California. Mr. Nute has been very successful 
in his business and owes wdiat he has achieved entirely to his own industry 
and enterprise, having had to depend on himself from boyhood. He was ap- 
pointed town clerk of his native village for years and after locating here was 
appointed postmaster in 1866. This office he has held for sixteen years, and 
so obliging and courteous has been his treatment of the patrons that he was 
universallv liked. The office is now in charge of his son, George. His 



234 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

success has not been unattended with difticulties. not least among which 
was the fire which swept away all his stock, or the burglars who twice visited 
his establishment and robbed him. Adverse circumstances did not long de- 
press him and he kept bravely on and has succeeded in laying up considerable 
property. He has a fine farm of one hundred and thirty acres, which he cul- 
tivates and from which he derives both profit and pleasure. He is a promi- 
nent member of the ]\Iasonic fraternity and also of the Presbyterian church 
at Clayton, in which he is a zealous worker and an elder. He has been the 
superintendent of the Sunday-school here for several }'ears and has done 
much to build it up and increase its membership. 

George A. Nute is also a native of Lincoln, Maine, and was born Decem- 
ber 14, 1852. He is the second son of the above and is one of the most 
prominent and influential business men of this vicinity. Educated primarily 
in the public schools, he afterward entered the Bryant & Stratton School in 
Boston and secured a good business education, which has been of infinite 
service to him in his subsequent career. He first entered his father's store 
as a clerk and soon made himself master of the business, when, in 1879, he 
was taken into partnership. On August 9, 1897, he was appointed postmas- 
ter and is very popular in that capacity. He is an agent for the West Jer- 
sey Mail & Transportation Company and does a large amount of business, 
being one of the energetic, wide-awake merchants who not only succeed 
themselves but also add to the prosperity of their home town by their enter- 
prising spirit. He is connected with a number of fraternal orders, being a 
member of the Masons, Odd Fellows, (iolden Eagle and Junior Order of 
American Mechanics. He has been twice married, his first wife. Miss Sadie 
E. Knisell, of this village, dying in 1894 and leaving one child, Hilda M. 
He then married Miss Mary E, Stevens, of Delaware, the ceremony being 
solemnized November 7. 1895. 



JOHN H. VANLEER. 



John H. Vanleer, the postmaster of Friesburg, Salem county, is one of 
the most enterprising and successful business men and citizens of this flour- 
ishing place. All local affairs are participated in by him with earnestness and 
patriotic spirit and he is looked up to and consulted by those having the best 
interests of this community at heart. 

The Vanleer family originated in Germany, where the name was spelled 
Van Loer. The great-grandfather of our suljject was a farmer of Mullica 
Hill. Salem county. New Jersev. and that he was an unusuallv strong and

active man mav l)e inferred from the fact that not long Ijefore his death, at the 
extreme age of one hundred and one >ears. he made a trip on horseback. Of 
his eleven children, Samuel \'anleer. the grandfather of John H.. was born 
near Swedesboro. this state, and was engaged in agricultural pursuits durmg 
his active life. Then he retired and made his home in Bridgeton, where he 
owned some property, in addition to which he possessed three farms and was 
well-to-do. He was a Democrat, and religiously was a member of the Luth- 
eran church. Bv his first marriage he had eleven children, namely: George; 
\nna, who married Dave Garrison and later John Callahan: ^lary. the wife 
of Abraham Harris and afterward of William Tarpin; ^lichael. Samuel, Wil- 
liam, Joseph, Isaac; Sallie, who remained unmarried; Susie and John. Of the 
union of Samuel Vanleer, Sr.. and Hannah Jerman. one son. Henry J., 
was born. Mary has been a missionary in Africa, but is now at home to 
recuperate her health, with the intention of returning to her work in Africa. 
The father of these children lived to reach the ninetieth anniversary of his 
birth. 

Isaac Vanleer, the father of our subject, was born in Deerfield township, 
Cumberland county, New Jersey, and, like his ancestors, made farming his 
chief business in life. However, he also carried on a flourishing trade m 
lumber and at one time he owned two farms, occupied numerous local public 
offices, and was influential and respected by his neighbors and associates. 
Politically he was a Democrat and religiously a Lutheran. His death oc- 
curred when he was about sixty years old, at the homestead in Deerfield 
township, where he had passed nearly all of his life. Not one of his sixteen 
children are deceased and all of them are strong and of fine physique, all but 
three weighing over two hundred pounds each. Mr. Vanleer's first marriage 
was to Susanna Kitchen, a daughter of John Kitchen, and five children 
were born of this union, namely: John H.; IMatilda. who is the widow of 
Samuel Davis, a farmer of Cumberland county, and has two sons,— Samuel 
and Chester; Horace, whose biography appears elsewhere; Sallie, the wife of 
Charles Nixon, a railroad employe, and mother of Margaret and Bertha; and 
Anna, the wife of William Coleman, a farmer and liveryman of Woodstown, 
Salem county. Mr. and Mrs. Coleman have one son, Frank, and a daughter, 
Louisa. After the death of his first wife, Isaac Vanleer wedded Christiana 
Johnston, and their eldest child, Isaac, married Jennie Irvin and is a produce 
commission merchant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Earl, a blacksmith, 
married Nina RufT and has one child; Walter has been married but has lost 
his wife; Charles and Susan,— married; Ellsworth, whose wife bore the 
maiden name of Mary Watson, is the father of two children; and the younger 
brothers and sisters are Bert. Emma, Evans, Milton and Mary. 



236 BIOGRAPHIVAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

The l)irth of John H. Vanleer occurred on the parental farm in Deerfield 
township, Cumberland county, September 5, 1845. His education was ac- 
quired in the public schools before he was eighteen years of age. after which 
he devoted his time to farming and engaged in threshing during a part of 
each year until he was about twenty-four years old. Subsequently to his 
marriage he carried on a farm in his native township for a period, and then 
bought a place near Shirley, this state, .\fter ojierating that farm for four 
years he located in Friesl)urg, where he owns and manages an eighty-three 
acre farm, carries on a blacksmith and carriage repairing shop, a steam grist 
and sawmill, a creamery and a general store. 

Since he settled in this p\zce he has been the postmaster, and for three 
years he has officiated as a member of the township committee. He is acti\'e in 
the Democratic party, but has not been an aspirant to public office. Like his 
forefathers, he is an adherent of the Lutheran church, and for si.x years he has 
been a deacon in the congregation to which he belongs. For a wife he chose 
Sarah E., a daughter of Joseph Rempster, a prosperous farmer of AUoway 
township. 



R. E. BUCK, :\I. D. 



-Although comparatively young in years. Dr. Buck is one of the largest 
practitioners of Newfield, Gloucester county. New Jersey, and his friends 
predict for him a brilliant future in the profession he has chosen. He was 
born in Cape ALay county, this state, October 11, 1870, and is a son of 
Crawford and Rebecca (Courson) Buck. His grandfather, Hope Buck, was 
a sea captain. Crawford Buck was Ijorn at Ocean View, New Jersey, and was 
a freeholder of Cape May county for many years. During the civil war he 
was on a tug boat. He was a professor of music and a well-known singer. 
He served as organist in the Baptist church for thirty-five years. He mar- 
ried Aliss Reljecca Courson, of the same locality, and they had three chil- 
dren: Josephine, the wife of Dr. Edward Hum])hrevs, of Pennsvh'ania: R. 
E., our subject; and Laura, a spinster. 

Dr. R. E. Buck received his primary education from tlie common schools. 
Later he received instructions from a professor and then entered Rush Medi- 
cal College, in 1891, graduating three years later. The same fall be received 
his degree of "SI. D. he came to this village, where he opened an office and 
began the practice of his profession. He has made an enviable record here 
and enjoys a wide and lucrati\e practice which necessitates him keeping two 
horses. His practice is not confined to this immediate vicinity, but his 
figure is familiar in all parts of the surrounding country, where be has been

Nina LeRoy. daughter of William LeRoy. of Nevvfield. He was for three 
years connected with the navy of Peru. They are earnest Christian people, 
members of the Baptist church, and are popular members of societx'. 



WILLIAM COLLINS. 



William Collins, the present sheriff of Gloucester county. New Jersey. 
is among the representative men of \\'oodbury. and has lived more than 
half a centurv in this countv. having lieen born May 24. 1845. near Cross 
Keys. Washington township. His parents were Abijah and Patience (Pease) 
Collins, fomier well known and respected citizens. The Collins family were 
among the earliest settlers and have been prominently identified with the 
historv of the countv. The great-grandfather was a soldier in the Revolu- 
tionar'v war and reared a family, among whom was William, the grandfather 
of our subject. He was born in this county and spent his life in the tillmg 
of the soil and became a prosperous and very prominent man. He marned 
Martha Morgan and reared a number of children, of whom but one. Joseph, 
is now living. Thev were Martha. Joseph and Abijah. He died in middle 
life, at fortv-eight vears of age, and was survived many years by his wife, who 
attained tlie extreme age of ninety-three years when she was laid to sleep 
beside her husband in the churchyard at Hurffville. Washington county, 
New Jersev. 

Abijah Collins was born July 12. 1820, ui Gloucester county, where so 
manv of that name were ushered into existence. He continued to make his 
home there and became a highly respected and prosperous farmer of that 
region, whose death on February 28. 1883, was regretted by the many 
who knew, honored and revered him. The maiden name of his wife was 
Patience Pease, a daughter of John and Rachel Pease, residents of Washing- 
ton township and among the earliest settlers of this county. She is the only 
surviving child of the four born to her parents. Her mother had been pre- 
viouslv married to Jonathan Kindle, b>- whom she had three children: Sarah 
(Mrs.'wilsie). Abraham and Catherine, deceased. Abijah Collins had five 
children: William, whose sketch we here present: George C, deceased; 
Charles E., Mary H. and Albert. 

William Collins was reared on the ancestral acres, attended the common 
schools and was inured to the hardship and toil incident to farm life. When 
he reached his majority he purchased a farm of one hundred acres, which 
he placed in a high state of cultivation, improved with a modern residence

and outljuildings, and made iiis liome here until 1896, when he took up his 
residence in Woodbury. He was a progressive agriculturist who adopted 
the easiest and most convenient method of performing his work, and much 
of his success which more shiftless neighbors would attribute to "luck" was 
but the application of common sense to common objects. 

On June 20, 1868, he was joined in wedlock with Miss Elizabeth Hurfif. 
a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth Hurfif. Four daughters have blessed 
this marriage: Lovisa, the wife of Walton H. Chew: Ruth, Alice and Iva. 
Air. Collins is a Republican and served as the collector of his township for 
ten years and was then elected to the office of sheriff in 1896, the position 
he has so creditably filled and still holds. He is a member of the Grange and 
of Glassboro Lodge, No. 85, F. & .\. \1.. and a zealous worker in the Aleth- 
odist Episcopal church, of which he is a trustee. 



THO:\IAS D(3NOVAN. 



An investigation of the li\-es of many of the leading business men of 
the country will show that they have started out for themselves very young 
without capital and have advanced steadily as the result of their own well 
directed efforts. Of such a class is Mr. Donovan, who is now owner of a 
grocer)' store at Sea Isle City. He was born in county Tipperary, 
Ireland, in November, 1862, a son of Dennis and Alice (Slatterly) Donovan. 
His grandfather, James Donovan, was born in the same county and there 
followed the occupation of farming'. In the Catholic church he was a 
communicant and in that faith died, at the age of eighty years. He wedded 
Margaret Duggan and their children were: Ellen, now deceased: Mar\", 
Dennis, Lawrence, John, and Thomas, who came to the United States, 
entered the L^nion army during the ci\il war and was killed in battle. Dennis 
Donovan has spent his entire life in the Emerald isle and has carried on 
farming as a means of livelihood. He, too, is a member of the Catholic church. 
He married Miss Alice Slatterly, who died February 13, 1895, at the age 
of sixty-frve years. They became the parents of seven children : James, who 
resides in South Amboy, New Jersey, where he is engaged in the baker's 
business, married Margaret Fitzgerald. Andrew is deceased. Thomas and 
Patrick are the next of the family. Margaret is also deceased. Catharine 
is the W'ife of an officer of the English army, now at Singapore, in the East 
Indies. William is in Ireland. 

Thomas Donovan, whose name heads this article, was educated in the 
national parish schools of the Emerald isle, but at the age of twelve years 



COXGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 239 

put aside his text-books and served an apprenticeship at the grocery and 
liquor business in Dubhn, Ireland. His term of service covered three years, 
but he remained with the house as an employe for seven years. Subse- 
quently he went to Liverpool, England, and about 1881 came to the United 
States, where he has since engaged in the grocery business. For a short 
time he was located in Philadelphia and in 1888 came to Sea Isle City, 
where he soon opened a small grocery. Not long after\*ard he purchased 
property and has since engaged in the grocery, feed and provision business. 
He has a large trade and his extensive patronage brings him a good income. 
He also owns a number of building sites at this place and is a mcml^ier of 
the Sea Isle City Building & Loan Association and New Jersey Building 
& Loan Investment Company. 

On the 22d of November, 1887, Mr. Donovan married Miss Afary 
McGary, and to them were born four children: William and Marie Angelo, at 
home, and Thomas and Joseph, who are both deceased. The parents are 
members of the Catholic church and 'Mr. Donovan belongs to the Clan- 
na-Gael of Philadelphia. His political support is given to the Democracy 
when questions of national importance are involved, but at local elections, 
where there is no political issue before the people, he casts his ballot for the 
man whom he thinks best qualified for office. The only position he has 
ever filled has been that of member of the board of health, for he prefers 
to devote his time and energies to his Ijusiness, in which he is meeting with 
creditable success. 



J. MORTON SHOCH. 



This substantial farmer of Woolwich township, Gloucester county, was 
born upon the farm where he now resides, March 8, 1866, and is a son of 
Captain Lewis and Margaret (Morton) Shoch. At the outbreak of the 
Civil war the father, who also was a "tiller of the soil," raised a company 
which was mustered in as Company C, Twenty-eighth New Jersey Volun- 
teers, and of which he served as the captain for three years. The paternal 
family consisted of five children, namely: Robert, a commission merchant 
in Richmond, \^irginia; Lewis 3*1., a farmer in A\''oolwich township; Harry 
B., a farmer near Paulsboro: J. Morton; and Lizzie B., the wife of Sumner 
Leap, a farmer near Bridgeport, New Jersey. 

While a boy 'Six. Shoch attended the district schools of his native town- 
ship, and assisted his father on the farm. After the death of his father he 
remained upon the old homestead, which is a fine piece of property situated 
on the stone road between Swedesboro and Paulsboro, near the Logan

township line. Here he carries on general farming, in wiiich he has been 
\er\' successful. 

yir. Shoch was married December 25, 1889, to Miss Ella Taylor, a 
daughter of James Taylor, of Swedesboro, and they are the parents of three 
children, — William H., Joseph C. and Raymond M. In politics Mr. Shoch 
coincides with the Republican party, and socially he is a member of the 
junior O. U. A. M., the A. O. U. \V. and the P. of H. 



JOSEPH D. WHITAKER. 

Nearly thirty-seven years ago Joseph D. W'hitaker, the popular post- 
master of Penn's Grove, took up his permanent residence in this place, and 
during this period he has thoroughly identified himself with every movement 
calculated to benefit the town. His history is of interest, for it is the record 
of a self-made man, — of one who has been obliged to work out the problems 
of life unaided and who has vanquished each difficulty presented to him. 

He is a grandson of William and Patience Whitaker, of Millville, New 
Jersey, and as his father, William H. Wliitaker, died when the child was but 
five years of age, and the mother, Mrs. Patience (Sheppard) Whitaker, when 
he was an infant of about two years, he went to live with his grandmother 
Sheppard, remaining under her hospitable roof until fourteen years of age. 
William H. \\'hitaker was a native of Cumberland county. New- Jersey, and 
at the time of his death he was in charge of a vessel engaged in the coast 
trade. He was a natural mechanic and sailor, and enjoyed the respect of all 
with whom he was associated. In the Presbyterian church of his home town 
he was an active member, and no one in that section was a stronger friend 
of the Sons of Temperance and the cause for which the association was or- 
ganized. He was an only son, and all of his four sisters, Susan, Rebecca. 
Eunice and Maria, have passed into the silent land, also. 

Joseph D. Whitaker, whose birth occurred in Cedar\ille, Cumberland 
county, August 18, 1840, was only twehe \ears of age when he commenced 
working on a farm in order to earn his own livelihood, and soon afterward 
he became interested in the oyster fisheries, accompanying men engaged in 
gathering that succulent bivalve on the Delaware river. Five years passed 
in this pursuit, and then the youth accepted a position as mate under Cap- 
tain Garrison. His time was spent in this manner for four years, after which 
he took charge of the schooner named David E. Wolf and for two and a 
half years continued as its master. Having carefully husbanded his resources, 
he was now enabled to purchase an interest in the schooner Jane C. Patter-

son. which he sailed for a period of four years, and then became a part owner 
of the schooner Richard \'aux. At the expiration of another four years he 
sold out his other shipping interests and built the schooner Jennie Middle- 
ton, of Bridgeton, Xew Jersey, which craft he sailed for some eight years, 
with success. Disposing of this vessel in 1879. he invested a goodh' sum in 
the brig Ellen H. Monroe, and four years later built the schooner Lewis K. 
Cottingham. of which he was the master for eight years and which he still 
owns. 

In 1863 ^Ir. W'hitaker took up his abode in Penn's Grove. In the autumn 
of 1884 he was honored by being elected to represent his district in the state 
legislature, and for two winter sessions he was at his post of duty. In 1887 
his name was again placed upon the Republican ticket, but he was defeated 
by about twelve votes. On New Year's Day, 1889, the appointment of post- 
master of Penn"s Grove was bestowed upon him, and he faithfully continued 
to serve in that capacity until September. 1893. At that time he embarked in 
the real-estate business, and among other enterprises in which he engaged 
was that of buying the old Clark gristmill, which he moved to its present 
location, remodeled and rebuilt, finally selling it March 25. 1899. His general 
efficiency and popularity during the period of his public service led to his sec- 
ond appointment to the postmastership of Penn's Grove, July 15, 1897, and 
this office he continues to fill with credit to himself and numerous friends, 
while at the same time he conducts a real-estate and private banking business. 
He is a member of the State Mutual Building & Loan Association of Cam- 
den. Xew Jersey, and of the Mutual Building & Loan Bank of Philadelphia, 
Ma}- 24, 1900. the Penn Grove National Bank was organized and Mr. \\'hit- 
aker was elected its president. 

The marriage of Mr. Whitaker and Miss Mar}- E. Simpkins was celebrated 
August 12. 1868. Four children were born to them, namely: \Mlliam H.. 
Jennie A., James and Lulu, who, one by one, have been summoned to the 
better land. Mrs. W'hitaker is a daughter of James and Mary (Bicldle) Simp- 
kins, of Penn's Grove. The father, one of the leading citizens of this place, 
was a prime mover in the building of the Emanuel Methodist Episcopal 
church, a substantial modern brick edifice. 



THE HAIXES (HAXES) FAMILY. 

During the greater part of the nineteenth century the Haines (Hanes) 
family, owning and residing at Eldridge Hill, their beautiful estate near 
Woodstown, Salem county, have been prominently associated with local 
history and in consequence are justly entitled to representation in the annals 



242 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

of this region. The ancestry may be traced back through many generations 
to William Haines, the founder of the family in America. He came from 
England to Salem, JNIassachusetts, about 1636. He married Sarah Ingersol. 
and their children were as follows: John, who was baptized in 1639; James, 
in 1641; Benjamin, in 1643; Mary, in 1646; James, in 1647; Jonathan, in 
1648; Sarah, in 1648; and Thomas. The last named was born in Salem, 
Massachusetts, in 165 1, and was married on the 15th of December, 1676, to 
Sarah Ray, of Salem. Their children were: John, who was born in 1678: 
William, in 1680; Sarah, in 1681; Joseph, in 1683; Benjamin, September 21, 
1685; Daniel, who was born in 1687 and died in 1689; Hannah, born in 1689-, 
and Thomas, born in 1691. This family all removed to Salem county. New 
Jersey, about 1697, ^nd were in Alannington and Piles Grove in 1731. Ben- 
jamin Haines, of this family, was born September 21, 1685, and died in 
Salem county. New Jersey, in 1733. There is record of a "power of attorney" 
made by Joseph Haines, Jr., and Thomas Haines, a "plantation man;" Dan- 
iel Haines, a carpenter of Mannington, New Jersey; and Roger Haggins 
and his wife, Sarah, of Piles Grove, New Jersey, giving their brother, Ben- 
jamin Haines, "weaver," also of Mannington. power to sell certain lands in 
Salem, Massachusetts, which formerly belonged to their father, Thomas 
Haines, which said Thomas received by will from his father, William Haines, 
and the latter received by will from his father-in-law, Richard Ingersoll, this 
document being dated September 20, 1731. There is a copy of the will of 
this Benjamin Haines, to whom was given the power of attorney. The will 
was made January 15, 1723, and was approved June 2, 1733. In this mention 
is made of his wife, Ann, and the following children: Joseph, Benjamin, 
John, Mary, Ann and Hannah. (All the ancestors above mentioned wrote 
the name Haines.) Of this family John Haines (who dropped the i from the 
name), born about the year 1720, had by his wife, Rebecca, two sons: Jo- 
seph and John. The latter was born May 12, 1747, and by his wife, Mar- 
garet, had six children: John, born April 9, 1791; Edward, born September 
24, 1792; Thomas, born June 16, 1794; Mary; Rebecca; and Catherine, who 
became Mrs. Eastlock and died in Wabash, Indiana. 

John Haines, the father of these children, was a native of Mannington 
township, Salem county, and passed his entire life in that locality. He was 
a mechanic and was dominated by the same industrious and practical traits 
of character noticeable in his posterity. His son Edward was born in the 
same township, September 24, 1792, and on the 12th of Alarch. 1814, married 
Esther Mullica. Three years later, in 1817, he came to Eldridge Hill, where 
his descendants have dwelt ever since. He inherited the talent for mechanics 
that his father had before him, and to his aid and influence was due in large

measure the establishment of the foundry Iiere, which lias been in success- 
ful operation for so many decades. When the ag;itation pro and contra slav- 
ery was waxing fiercer and fiercer he became a stanch Abolitionist and took 
great interest in the emancipation of the slaves. A few years prior to his 
death he joined the Society of Friends, and was loved and highly iTonored 
in their ranks. Death released him from the toils and sorrows of this life 
September 23, 1880. He had one lirother. John, who was born April 9, 
1791. His sister. Rebecca, married Israel Eastlake, November 16, 1820, 
and another sister, Catherine, became tiie wife of Samuel Eastlake, Febru- 
ary 1 1. 1824. 

Of the children born to Edward and Esther Flaines (Hanes) only two are 
now living: Thomas, to whom reference is made later; and Miss Emily, 
who was born at Eldridge Hill in 1824, and wdiose entire life has been spent 
in this immediate locality, where she is loved and respected by a large circle 
of old friends and old associates. Her brothers, Edward, William, Samuel 
and John, and her sisters, Margaret and Rhoda, have one by one passed 
to the better land. John Haines (Hanes), born August 16, 1818, at Eldridge 
Hill, married Abigail, a daughter of John and Sarah Brown, and had one 
daughter, Florence, all now deceased. John Haines (Hanes) was of a prac- 
tical turn of mind, and for many years was actively interested in the man- 
agement of the foundry here, being connected with that flourishing industry 
until a short time before his demise, which event occurred March 23, 1897. 
With the exception of a short period which he spent at Camden, New Jersey, 
he always made his home here and was greatly respected by everv one. 
His genuine ability and sterling worth were recognized, although in manner 
he appeared rather stern and dignified. Benevolent and kindlv toward his 
fellows, in truth, he quietly performed many a deed of charitv and lent a 
helping hand to the poor and unfortunate on numerous occasions. In his 
financial undertakings he achieved success, and. being a great reader and 
thinker, took an active interest in the leading cjuestions of the times. 
Thomas Haines (Hanes), born in 181 6, in this locality, and now li\ing on 
the old family estate with his sister. Miss Emily, was a resident of Vineland, 
New Jersey, for thirty years. When a youth he was apprenticed to the 
contractor and builder's trade, and, having mastered the calling, he con- 
tinued to follow it until his father, retiring from active business life, Thomas, 
who possessed all the traditional mechanical qualifications of his ancestors, 
succeeded him in the foundry. Under his wise management the business grew 
rapidly. He retired in 1862. immediately after the death of his wife. He 
was married to Mary, a daughter of John and Deborah Warrington, in 1841. 
She died in 1862. aged forty-nine. Their eldest child, Edward, died in 



244 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

1864. at the age of twenty-one. Their three daughters are Ellen; Elizabeth, 
the wife of William Taylor and mother of three children. Mary, Margaret 
and Edward, who died in infancy: and Laura, the wife of Clark Ridgway 
and the mother of one daughter, Helen. 

Thus, as may be seen, Thomas Haines (Hanes), now in his eighty-fourth 
year, is the only surviving male representative of the Haines (Hanes) family, 
whose geneaology is perfected, without a broken link, back to England, 
covering a space of over two hundred and sixty years. The family name 
has undergone many changes. It was derived from a Saxon word signi- 
fying "a man that needs no help." In 1540 it was written Hayne. later 
on Haynes, and still later Haines. The i was dropped from the name by 
the grandfather of Thomas. John and Emily to distinguish the family from 
others of the same name. In all the records of the family, on this side of the 
ocean, dating from if'3'' -o i/Qi. it is written Haines: after 1791 we find it 
written Hanes. 

A coat of arms granted the familx earl\- in 1500 bears this motto: "There 
is no ditilicultv to him that wills."

in 1882. He at once opened an ofiice and began the practice of his profes- 
sion in Salem, where he has been located ever since and has a large and 
extensive practice, covering a wide territory and embracing a class of patients 
that speak well for his efiiciency as a physician. He has been most fortunate 
in his practice and displays a proficiency and skill in the treatment of disease 
that is unsurpassed, and has brought him into prominence in the medical 
profession in this vicinity.

GEORGE H. REEVES. 



Everywhere in our land are found men who have worked their own w"ay 
from humble and lowly beginnings to places of leadership in the commerce, 
the great productive industries and the management of the veins and arteries 
of the tralific and exchanges of the country. Obstacles and difficulties in their 
path seem but to serve as an impetus for renewed effort on their part, and 
they find that labor is the key that unlocks the portals of success. Such has 
been the career of Mr. Reeves, w ho now occujjies a leading position in the 
industrial circles of Cape May county, being now at the head of an extensive 
gold-beating concern in Cape May. 

A native of West Cape May. he was born January 29, 1849, and is a son 
of Joshua and Eleanor (Woolson) Reeves. His father was a shoemaker and 
farmer in West Cape May and a representative man of that town. He was 
a great Bible student and particularly prominent in church work. He served 
for many years as ruling elder in the Presbyterian church at Cold Spring and 
took an active part in the work of the Sunday-school. He was a strong o]d- 
ponent of the liquor traffic, belonged to the Sons of Temperance, and gave 
his aid and influence to all measures which he believed would uplift humanity. 
His death occurred in the forty-seventh year of his age, and his wife died in 
August, 1898, at the advanced age of eighty-four years. This worthy couple 
were the parents of eleven children, two of whom died young, — Charles \\'. 
and Anna E. The other nine are as follows: David, a gold-leaf manufacturer 
of Cincinnati, Ohio, married Lizzie A. Mc\^'illiams, and had one son. Lewis 
F. Swain S.. a farmer at Cape May Point, in Lower township, married S\l- 
vina Church, and their children are George H.. Edward S. and Elmer. 
Andrew H., a gold-leaf manufacturer, of Chicago, Illinois, married Carrie 
Bright, of Illinois, and had four children, — Eleanor, Harry, Carrie and 
Charles Fowler. John ^^'.. a farmer of West Cape ]\Iay, who has several times 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 247 

served as freeholder and is now sheriff of Cape May county, married Emma 
L. Nott, and their children are Andrew H., David Leroy, A. Carl and Samuel 
W. Joshua H., a lighthouse-keeper at Seal Isle City, married Josephine 
Ross, and their children are Bertha and John W. Mary E. is the deceased 
wife of Charles Schellenger, and their children were Jennie, Taylor and Wash- 
ington. George H. is the next of the family. Eliza W. is at home; and Anna 
E. is the wife of Fred Neal. a farmer in Rio Grande, and their children are 
Lydia and Warren. 

Mr. Reeves, whose name introduces this review, was educated in the old 
Cape school-house, and at the age of fourteen l:)egan to earn his own liveli- 
hood. He learned the gold-beating trade in Philadelphia and for four years 
was indentured to his brother. Andrew H.. in Chicago. He became foreman 
of the shop in 1866 and thus continued until the great Chicago fire of Oc- 
tober, 1 87 1, when his brother's plant was destroyed and he then returned to 
the east, being employed in a gold-beating establishment in Philadelphia, 
in 1871-2. He then returned to Chicago and again became foreman for his 
brother, who had resumed business, and with whom he remained until 1878, 
when owing to failing health he again came to the east. Here he worked on 
a railroad with a section gang for a dollar a day and had a hard struggle for 
some time. He applied for a position in a large factory, but did not obtain 
it because he would not comply with the conditions of the labor organization. 
He was afterward sought by the firm of Hastings & Company to establish 
a business at Cape May, and he began operations on a small scale, his force 
of employes consisting of two boys and two girls. After two years he was 
sought to manage a factory which the firm desired to establish at Cape May, 
in 1879. The factory was opened with six employes, but under his manage- 
ment the business steadily increased until employment is now furnished to 
eighty operatives, and the output is large and the business profitable. Mr. 
Reeves superintended the building of the factory, which is forty by forty feet 
and two stories in height. There are now three departments, — a beating, 
a filling and a cutting department. WHien Mr. Reeves opened the factory he 
employed untrained workmen, taught them the business and thus secured 
competent employes. He is ever just and considerate in his treatment of 
them and they know that faithfulness on their part will win promotion as 
opportunity offers. This is now one of the paying business concerns of the 
city, a fact which is due to the competent management of Mr. Reeves. 

On the 19th of January, 1871, Mr. Reeves married Miss Georgiana H. 
Bancroft, a daughter of Reuben F. Bancroft, of Philadelphia. Their children 
are as follows: Theodore \\'., who married Mary Hughes, by whom he has a 
son, Orien ^^^. is foreman in the gold-beating establishment, is a memljer

Sunday-school there, is the archon of his local society in the Order of Hep- 
tasophs, and was a delegate to the national convention of that order in Buf- 
falo, in 1899; Reuben B., the younger son, is now a student of music in the 
South Jersey Institute, where he has spent three years. 

In political affairs Mr. Reeves is a Republican and a recognized leader 
in the ranks of the party. He was the mayor of West Cape May from 1893 
until 1897, and his administration was progressive and beneficial. He is 
now serving as a justice of the peace and has been a notary public, com- 
missioner of deeds, collector and a member of the school-board several terms. 
He is also a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen and belongs 
to the First Methodist Episcopal church in Cape May, in which he has held 
various offices. He has been a member of the board of trustees ten years, was 
the Sunday-school superintendent three years, and for ten or fifteen years has 
been a local preacher. His life has ever been an upright and honorable one 
and over the record of his public and private career there falls no shadow of 
wrong or suspicion of evil. He is thoroughly honorable in all business deal- 
ings and at all times commands and deser\-es the confidence of his fellow men.

at the age of seventy-three years: anrl tlie mother also jjassed away at seventy- 
three years of age. 

Air. ^\'el!s of this sketch was educated in the pubHc schools of Dennis- 
ville, but put aside his text-books at the age of sixteen in order to give his 
undivided attention to the cuhivation of his father's farm. He pursued the 
labors of the field and homestead until twenty-three years of age. when he 
started out for himself by learning the Initcher's trade. He drove a meat 
wagon for thirteen years, selling throughout the neighborhood, and then 
came to Sea Isle City, when there were but six business houses in the town. 
Here he opened a grocery, meat and provision business, also extended his 
field of operations by dealing in coal and ice. In 1896 he purchased his 
present ice plant. He also has a fish pond, in which he catches fish for the 
market in this section of the state. From time to time he has invested his 
capital in real estate and is now the owner of much valuable property at Sea 
Isle City and at Avalon. He also owns the Dennisville Hotel, which is situ- 
ated in the midst of a six-acre tract of land. Of the Dennisville Building & 
Loan Association he is a member; also of the Sea Isle City Association and 
the New Jersey Building & Loan Bank. 

On the 24th of December, 1874, was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Wells 
and Miss Eliza Ludlum, and in the city where they make their home the}- 
have many warm friends. He is a stanch advocate of Democratic principles. 
yet at local elections votes for the man rather than the party. He served as 
a member of a company of home guards, of Dennisville, in 1861, has been a 
member of the city council, and was also the first mayor of Sea Isle City. 
He gives his support freely and generously to all measures calculated to 
prove a public benefit and has been a prominent factor in the progress of the 
town in which he makes his home. Earnest and well directed labor, com- 
bined with clear discernment in placing his investments, has brought to Air. 
W^ells a very gratifying and desirable success, and though he started out in 
life empty-handed he steadily worked his way upward, having long since left 
the ranks of the manv to stand among the successful few. 



ADAM KANDLE. 



The elificient postmaster of Elmer was born in Mannington township. 
Salem county, October 18, 1850, and is of German lineage. His father. 
Mathias Kandle, a son of Adam Kandle, was born in Pittsgrove, Salem 
county, and was a farmer throughout life. He served as a freeholder, and 
for a number of years was a leading and active member of the Methodist 
Episcopal church, of Olivet. New Jersey. His death occurred in 1893. His 



250 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

wife, Amelia, was a daughter of John Anderson, who is a native of Scotland 
and is still living, at the age of seventy-nine years. In their family were 
thirteen children, of whom the following reached years of maturity, namely: 
Mrs. ilargaret Ayers, of Deerfield: ]\Irs. Susanah F. Ogden, of North \'ine- 
land: ^Irs. Amelia Johnson, of Centerline; Joshua R., of the same place: and 
Adam. 

^Ir. Kandle, of this review, attended the public schools in his youth and 
entered upon his business career as an apprentice at the carpenter and build- 
er's trade. He followed that vocation for twenty-one years at this place and 
was therefore active in promoting the interests of the town. Many of the 
good buildings stand as monuments to his thrift and enterprise and indicate 
the liberal patronage which he received in the line of his trade. He is now 
serving as postmaster, to which position he was appointed by President Mc- 
Kinley on the 9th of August, 1897. 

In his political views Mr. Kandle is a stanch Republican and keeps well 
informed on the questions and issues of the day. In 1888 he was appointed 
census enumerator in the lower part of the first congressional district. He 
has been a delegate to the various conventions of his party and is a recog- 
nized leader in its ranks. He has long been a faithful member of the Presby- 
terian church, for eleven years served in its board of trustees, and has also 
been superintendent of the Sunday-school for a number of years. Thus in 
various ways he has aided in the progress of the community in material, 
political, social and moral lines, and is one of the most valued citizens of 
Elmer. 

On the 25th of March. 1874, was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Kandle 
and Miss Anna Langley, daughter of ^\'illiam Langley. who was a represen- 
tative of one of the old families of the township. They became the parents 
of ten children, six of whom are living, as follows: Sarah E., a resident of 
Atlantic City; Mathias ^SL. of Philadelphia; William L., who is serving as 
assistant postmaster in Elmer; and Harry O., Ada C. and Carrie C, all at 
home. Such in brief is the history of one of the well known and highly 
esteemed citizens of Elmer, whose devotion to the public welfare and fidelity 
to the duties of business and private life have won him the regard of all with 
whom he has associated.

it at several national conventions of the union. He was married in Cam- 
den, in 1872, to Miss Harriet Smith, of Glassboro. Of their four children 
only two are living, the subject of this sketch and a daughter named Eva 
Alenda. 

During his early boyhood Dr. Gifford attended the common school and 
laid the foundation of a good education. At the age of fourteen, however, 
it became necessary for him to enter the ranks of the wage-earners, and for 
several years he was employed in the Whitney Glass Works. At first he 
made molds and then learned the trade of machinist and faithfully performed 
all the duties required of him. But this career did not satisfy his ambition 
or desire for knowledge, and he determined to fit himself for another sphere 
in life. Throughout the last three years of his work at his trade he attended 
the night school of the Young Men's Christian Association and the Spen- 
cerian Business College at Philadelphia. To do this he was obliged to take 
a train every night at Philadelphia, a distance of eighteen miles, and return 
so as to be at his place of work in the morning. One can imagine at what a 
sacrifice of ease and rest this was accomplished. 

In 1894 this persistent young man became a student in the Pennsyl- 
vania College of Dental Surgery, at which he was graduated in 1897. As 
a further proof of his energy and courage it may be stated that during the 
summer vacation of 1894 he worked as a conductor on an Atlantic Citv 
trolley car and probably made himself as popular in this capacity as in other 
places, as his car was credited with turning in more money than anv other 
car on the line. During a part of his time in college he took charge of 
the practice of one of the professors. He was in the offices of Dr. S. T. Beale, 
Jr., and Dr. Rupert Beale, 11 16 Girard street, Philadelphia, two years. Dr. 
Rupert Beale lectures and demonstrates in the Penn College of Dental 
Surgery. Dr. S. T. Beale, Jr., is a son of Dr. S. T. Beale, Sr., deceased, who 
was one of the number to start the first dental college in Philadelphia, the 
second dental college in the world. Dr. Rupert Beale is a son of Dr. S. T.

college Dr. Gifford was a member of the C. N. Pierce Dental Society and 
was one of the organizers of the college branch of the Young ]Men's Chris- 
tian Association and of the College Glee Club. He was the first student 
"marked oft'" in the college work of the last year at college. He belongs to 
the State Dental Society, the South Jersey Dental Society, the Gloucester 
County Medical Society, the State Medical Society and the Odd Fellows, and 
is active in all public enterprises, a most genial and companionable young 
gentleman and a great favorite in society. 

In his profession Dr. Gifford has attained a rare degree of excellence 
and commands one of the best practices in South Jersey. With a continua- 
tion of the industry, energy and perseverance he has hitherto shown he can- 
not fail of success in whatever he may undertake. 



HON. THOMAS M. FERRELL. 

Hon. Thomas M. Ferrell, ex-congressman, of Glassboro, New Jersey. Ijy 
reason of his long and faithful ]nil)lic service, is justly entitled to more than 
a passing notice in this connection. In recording the biography of men it 
becomes a pleasure, as well as a duty, to chronicle the things performed 'jy 
the subject for others, as well as for his own personal lienefit. 

'Sir. Ferrell was born in Glassboro. New Jersey, June 20, 1844. His father 
was James Ferrell, a native of Port Elizabeth, Cumberland county. New Jer- 
sey. The grandfather also was James Ferrell, and he was born in England, 
and had both Scotch and English blood in his veins. He settled in Mon- 
mouth county. New Jersey, and followed mercantile business. He was a 
captain in the time of the Revolutionary war and a prominent figure in that 
fierce struggle for liberty. James Ferrell. the father of our subject, moved at 
an early day to Gloucester county, settling at Fisler\ille, now Clayton. He 
made pots for the annealing furnaces then in operation and later in life 
followed farming. He was for a long time the supervisor of highways. A 
man of excellent judgment and full of generous, good deeds, he was an ardent 
Methodist and for man)- vears was one of the church officers. He married 
Emeline Durr, the daughter of Alexander Durr. of Philadeli)hia, Pennsyl- 
vania. Our subject now resides on the very spot where was built the resi- 
dence of the first glass-makers of America, and his father was an expert at 
making the peculiar pots in which glass is melted. Mr. James Ferrell, Jr.. 
died Januar)- 10, 1894. The good wife still sur\i\'es. aged eighty years. Of 



COXGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF iXEW JERSEY. 253 

their seven children, three are living: Joseph, our subject and Benjamin T.. 
all living at Glassboro. 

Bearing more directly on the career of our subject, let it be said that he 
had quite a struggle to gain an education. He went to the common schools, 
and at a verv early age had to work in the glass factory. He began to work 
at glass-making when only sixteen years of age and continued at it as an 
apprentice until he was twenty-one, b\- this time knowing the business thor- 
oughly. In 1878 he was elected president of the Hollow-ware Glass Workers" 
Association of the United States, holding that ofifice until 1883. Politically 
Thomas M. Ferrell af^liates with the Democratic party. He served as a 
township committeeman for three years. In 1879 he went to the legislature, 
receiving a large majority of the \'otes cast in a very strong Repul^lican dis- 
trict. He was bitterly opposed all over the country by the manufacturers, 
on account of his having been president of the above named association. 
They put up a glass-blower to beat him, but failed. It was Mr. Ferrell who 
organized and put on a permanent basis the Druggistware Glass-blowers' 
Union of the United States and Canada, which has two hundred branches. 
He was also the author of the weight list, providing that the size shall not 
control but the weight, and this principle established by him now governs the 
trade and fixes the rate of sale as well as the price paid the blowers. Mr. Fer- 
rell was re-elected to the legislature in 1880. In 1881 he was sent to the 
senate, where he championed many important measures and introduced many 
bills for the benefit of the workingmen, and his influence was felt in l)oth tlie 
upper and lower houses. Having served well in the capacity of a legislator, 
he was nominated and elected in 1882 to a seat in congress, where he served 
one term. The first clause of the present law restricting foreign labor brought 
to this countrv under contract was introduced by him. In 1885 he was 
appointed the collector of internal revenue for the first district of New Jersey, 
and held this office for four and one half years, after which he had charge for 
four years of the sinking fund of the state of New Jersey. In the state con- 
vention of 1900 he was elected one of the delegates at large to the Kansas 
City National convention by a unanimous vote, every county in the state 
placing him in nomination. 

In business he is now connected with the Woodbury Glass Works. He 
has been a member of the Glassboro board of education for many years, and 
has been its president, as well as very active in its affairs and in its reorganiza- 
tion. He has been a busy man of affairs, but never neglected the higher 
things — those which pertain to religious life and duty. He has been a mem- 
ber of the Methodist Episcopal church since he was fourteen years of age. 
and has been an active worker, a clas.s-leader and recording steward.

BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



Greatly interested in Sunday-school work, he has served actively here, has 
been the superintendent and filled other offices in this sphere. In lodge 
connections he stands high. He belongs to the Masonic and Odd Fellows 
orders; has been the master of his Masonic lodge and noble grand of the 
Xew Jersey state grand lodge of the Odd Fellows. 

Like most sensible men, our worthy subject believes in the value of a 
good home, presided over by a truly good wife. He was married on August 
23, 1873, to Miss Emma T. Stanger, the daughter of Richard G. Stanger, of 
an old and highly respected pioneer family of this section. Their home is 
blessed with one child, Emma. 

In reviewing this busy man's life one hardly knows where to award the 
most praise. His life from verv boyhood has been crowded full of labor of 
hand and head and heart, for the betterment of the toiling masses, all of 
whom are his firm friends. It should here be said to his credit that it was by 
his influence that the legislature of his commonwealth enacted the law doing 
away with the "store-order," "shin-plaster" and "pass-book" systems. One 
of his crowning works is the establishment of a National Labor Bureau. In 
1881 he represented Assembly No. 799, Knights of Labor, at their general 
assembly at Detroit, Michigan, and has ever worked for the good of this 
order. It matters not where one finds this gentleman, he is the same thor- 
ough, thoughtful, painstaking man, ever ready to befriend the poor and op- 
pressed. Indeed, the world has by far too few of such royal characters among 
the rank and file of its busy workers. He stands in the front rank of the 
"plain people" of the land. Where selfishness abounds, no such generous 
type of manhood can be found shining forth in glorious l)ril]iancy. 



SAMUEL SCHURCH. 



This gentleman is serving as the tax collector at (Dcean City, wliere for 
some years he has occupied positions of public trust, always discharging his 
duties in a capable and prompt manner, thus winning the approval of all his 
fellow townsmen. He has also been an active factor in business affairs, and 
is ranked among the representative citizens of Cape May county. 

He was born in Philadelphia, December 6, 1845, his parents being Samuel 
and Sarah (Pennick) Schurch. Back to Switzerland the ancestry of the fam- 
ily is traced. John Schurch. the ]3aternal grandfather, was a resident of 
canton Berne. Switzerland, and on crossing the Atlantic in 1806, accom- 
panied by his wife and children, he located in Germantown, Pennsylvania, 
where he spent the remainder of his life. He was a lileacher by trade, and 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 255 

followed that business for many years. During the Swiss-French war he 
entered the service and acted as one of Napoleon's body guards, having 
saved the general's life during a sortie in that war. He held a membership 
in the Lutheran church, and in that faith reared his family of four children, 
— Christian, Peter, Fannie and Samuel. His death occurred at the age of 
ninety years, and his wife passed away at the advanced age of ninety-five years. 
The family is noted for longevity. 

Samuel Schurch, the father of our subject, was born in canton Berne, in 
1804, and therefore was very young when brought by his parents to the New- 
World. He became a quill and ink manufacturer, and was one of the last 
to engage in making quills, closing out that business because it was super- 
seded by the manufacture of steel pens. He was reared in Germantown and 
learned the baker's trade. For many years he resided in Philadelphia, where 
he carried on business, but his death occurred in Bridgeboro, New Jersey. 
By his ballot he supported the Republican party. A faithful member of the 
German Reformed church, he took a very active part in its w'ork, was treas- 
urer and Sunday-school superintendent for thirty years, and at the same time 
acted as treasurer of another church. He had a membership relation with the 
United Beneficial Society, of which he was the treasurer and secretary, and 
at all times he was a friend to the poor and needy, withholding his support 
from none whom he believed to be worth}' of assistance. At his death his 
pastor said of him that he was one of the most honest of men and faithfully 
exemplified the teachings of the church in that respect. He had acted as a 
member of the home guards, and was very enthusiastic in regard to military 
matters, attempting to join the army during the civil war, but as he had 
passed the regulation age his services were rejected. He married Miss Sarah 
Pinnick, and they became the parents of eleven children, six of whom are 
living: Adeline, wife of Bernard Nieweg; John, who married Henrietta Nie- 
weg; George N., Martha, Charles and Frances. The father of these children 
died in April, 1880, at the age of seventy-six years, and the mother, who was 
born in 1803, died in 1895, at the age of ninety-three years. 

I\Ir. Schurch, of this review, acquired his education in the grammar 
schools of Philadelphia, but put aside his text-books at the age of sixteen 
years in order to enter his country's service. He was one of the boy soldiers 
of the war of the Rebellion, becoming a drummer of Company C, Fortieth 
Infantry. He was sent to the frontier at Williamsport, Alarvland, remaining 
there for the term of his enlistment. — nine months. Subsequentlv he en- 
gaged in the manufacture of drums for the government, in Philadelphia, and 
later he devoted his energies to the photographic business for four years, 
being connected with his brother in that enterprise at Scranton, Pennsvl- 



256 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

vania. Subsequently he was associated witli his father in the manufacture 
of quills and ink. They also dealt in stationery, and later he handled butchers' 
supplies, carrying on operations in that line from 1869 until 1875. when he 
bought out his father's business and admitted his brother William to the 
partnership. They conducted the enterprise until 1879, when Mr. Samuel 
Schurch sold out to his brother and removed to Butler county, Nebraska, 
where he engaged in stock farming until 1888. In that year he returned to 
the east, locating at Ocean City, where he followed carpentering and also 
conducted the Bellevue bath houses, the largest bath houses on the beach, 
situated between Seventh and Eighth streets. In 1894 he was elected tax 
collector and treasurer, filling that office until 1897, when he was again 
chosen tax collector, since which time he has been the incumbent of that 
position. In addition to his ofificial duties he also conducts a summer Ijoarcl- 
ing-house. He is the owner of a number of lots at Ocean City. 

On the 29th of December, 1868, Mr. Schurch wedded Marie Emilie 
Heine, a daughter of Louis Heine. They have had seven children: George, 
deceased; Bertha, wife of Frederick S. Carter, a bricklayer, by whom she 
has one child, Ethel; Sarah, deceased; Helen Louisa, Charles Edward, Har- 
riet Mattie and Edna x\ugusta. Mr. Schurch belongs to the Masonic fra- 
ternity, holding membership in St. Paul Lodge, No. 481, in Philadelphia: 
also in Palestine Chapter. No. 240, R. A. M. He belongs to the Junior 
Order of United .\merican Mechanics, at Ocean City, and formerly was con- 
nected witli that organization in the state of his birth. His political support 
is given the Republican part}-, and he labors earnestly to promote its growth 
and insure its success. At all times he has manifested the same loyalty to his 
duties of citizenship as when he follo\\e(l the old f^ag to the south in the 
civil war. 



DR. M. J. PALDING. 

The name of Dr. Palding was for many years a household one in Dare- 
town and surrounding country, and none knew him but to love and honor 
him. 

He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March 16, 1843, a son of 
Theopolis Palding, who was a native of Daretown, New Jersey. The his- 
tory of the Paldings in this countrj- goes back to colonial days. The fam- 
ilv now have in their possession parchment deeds for large tracts of land in 
Bucks county, Pennsylvania, and Salem county. New Jersey, and also for 
lots in Philadelphia, dating as far back as 1648. Isaac Palding, an uncle of 
the subject of this sketch, was a soldier in the war of 1812. Theopolis Paid-

ing was a self-made man. He went to Philadelphia early in life and as a boy 
en'tered the employ of the firm of Taylor & Johnson, of that city, which was 
afterward changed to Taylor & Palding, when he was taken in as a partner. 
In Philadelphia M. J. Palding passed his boyhood days, attending the 
common schools until he was twelve years old. He then went to Mount 
Aaron Seminary, at Norristown, Pennsylvania, and later to the popular 
school at Mount Holly. Taking up the study of medicine, he entered the 
University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with the degree of M. D. 
in 1865. After his graduation Dr. Palding came down to Daretown to the 
old homestead, which had been bought by the family for a country place, and 
here opened an ofifice and entered upon his professional career. — a career 
which was attended with marked success and the untimely ending of which 
brought sorrow to all the people of the town and adjacent country. Decem- 
ber 26, 1893, while crossing the railroad tracks at Woodstown, five miles 
from his home, he was struck by a passing train, his horse being killed and 
he being thrown some distance and injured to such an extent that he died 
soon afterward! 

Dr. Palding wa? not only a skilled physician and surgeon, but also 
was an all-round gentleman in every sense of the word. His fine personal 
appearance, together with his scholarly attainments, his very large-hearted 
nature and his charm of manner made him a favorite with all. old and young 
alike. While he was devoted to his profession, and was a member of variotts 
medical organizations, he found time for other matters and was always ready 
to give his support to any worthy public enterprise. He was for a time the 
president of the Agricultural Association, which held its meetings at Woods- 
town. For years he was interested in farming operations, making a specialty 
of the stock business, keeping the choicest of fine cattle and horses, and 
perhaps did more than any other man to give the county the reputation it 
has for tine stock. In both educational and church matters he was active 
and influential, being a member of the congregation of the Presbyterian 
church and one of its liberal supporters. For years he was a member of the 
Daretown school board. His large practice took him for miles into the coun- 
try, through sunshine and rain: and he never stopped to ask whether it was 
to the bedside of the rich or the poor he was called, ever giving to both his 
best efforts. Manv there are among his patients who can testify to his gen- 
erosity and his untiring energy. 

The terms "devoted husband" and "loving father" truly applied to him. 
He was married February 25, 1868. to Miss Helen Gerrish. a daughter of 
John C. Gerrish. of Philadelphia. Mrs. Palding, like the Doctor, belongs to 
a familv long resident in this country. She traces her ancestry to Revolu-

ticnary stock. To Dr. and ]\Ir.s. Palding were born eight children, namely: 
John G. and Theodore, twins. Walter E., Moses J., Henry S., George LI., 
Josephine and Margaretta. 



SMITH BILDERBACK. 



Smith Bilderback is a well known and highly respected citizen of Salem, 
Salem county, New Jersey, and descended from a long line of ancestors who 
made their home in Salem county, the first one having come from Sweden. 
He is a son of Thomas and Sarah (Dubois) Bilderback and was born in the 
village of AUoway, this county, September 10, 18 19. His grandfather was a 
life-long resident of Pittsgrove township, where he died before the h\nh of 
our subject. His children were Richard, Samuel, Martha and Thomas, the 
father of our subject. Samuel's daughter Hannah married Adam Smith, a 
morocco dresser of Philadelphia. 

Thomas Bilderback was born September 3. 1797, in Pittsgrove township 
and learned the carpenter's trade, which he followed throughout his active 
business career. The greater part of his life was passed in Alloway. but sev- 
eral years before his death he suffered a stroke of paralysis which left him so 
disabled that he was forced to retire from active labor and moved with his 
family to Salem, where his last ten years were spent, passing away in 1858, 
in his sixty-second year. He was a Democrat and took an intelligent interest 
in the success of his party, to which he contributed in no uncertain manner. 
He held a number of local ofifices, including that of freeholder, also having 
a seat in the legislative halls of New Jersey in 1847. He was an ardent advo- 
cate of the Democracy as expounded by Jackson. He united with the Bap- 
tist church of Alloway and later was associated with the First Baptist church 
of Salem, and was' a man of lofty principles and high ideals. He first wedded 
Miss Sarah Dubois, who became the mother of our subject. Four children 
were born to them. Henrietta, the eldest, born in 181 7, married Frederick 
Knaufft, a morocco merchant of New York city. Smith Bilderback was the 
second child. John, the third, was born in 1823 and married Elizabeth Sick- 
ler. He was a veteran of the war of the Rebellion and a carpenter of Salem, 
where he died. Amanda died in infancy. The mother died in her thirty-sixth 
year and the father placed at the head of his motherless household \lrs. 
Phoebe (Walker) Peck. By this union there were five children: Sarah, who 
married Richard Waddington, of Elsinboro; Hannah and Thomas, both of 
whom died in infancy; Phoebe Ann, who married William Wilkinson, of 
Connecticut: Ellen Augusta, who married Tames S. Gibbon, of Philadel-

phia. The third wife, nee Eunice Lawrence, also had five children: Hannah, 
who married Thomas McCrea, of Delaware; Emma, who died in childhood: 
Thomas, who fought in the civil war. but died in early life; (George, who 
married Miss Tamar Lewis, of Delaware: and Mary, who died in infancy. 

Smith Bilderback was educated in the ]iav schools of Alloway imder the 
tutorship of \V. W. Wood, a well known and popular instructor of that day. 
Later he was under the instruction of Jonathan L. Brown, of the same place. 
He left school when he was nineteen to learn the trade of carpenter, serving a 
regular apprenticeship to his father, and another to Empson Haines, who 
had a splendid reputation as a skillful mechanic. While working with him 
they completed the Methodist Episcopal church edifice at Sharptown. Soon 
afterward he entered into partnership with his father, the firm being known 
as Thomas Bilderback & Son. and continued to do contracting and building 
until the breaking out of the civil war. They were master workmen and their 
services were in demand all through that section of the country. 

On October 8, 1861, he enlisted for three years' service in the Ninth New 
Jersey Regiment, Company L under Captain Henry Chew. The company 
was in camp at Olden, Trenton, and Mr. Bilderback was detailed at once 
as the regimental commissary sergeant, having charge of the supplies of the 
regiment. This was a non-commissioned office superior in rank to lieutenant, 
and he served in that capacity for two years, until he contracted a fever and 
was obliged to return home on furlough to recuperate his strength. He again 
enlisted in Company F, Thirty-fourth Regiment, under Captain Henry Reed, 
and was appointed as second lieutenant. Under the first enlistment he was 
in the Burnside expedition and for three weeks lay olT Cape Hatteras in a 
terrible storm in which many vessels were sunk and great loss of life was 
suffered. They also lost much of their supplies, causing great deprivation. 
He had many narrow escapes, was at the battle of Roanoke Island, at White 
Hall and numerous other engagements. The regiment was first sent to camp 
on Bladenburg Pike, near Washington, D. C. where they remained until 
January, 1862. Thej were then assigned to the Seventh Brigade, in General 
Burnside's corps, and went to Annapolis. Maryland, where, on January 9, 
they embarked for North Carolina, their operations being confined to the 
states of North and South Carolina and Georgia. They were then assigned 
to the Second Brigade, Casey's division and later to the First Brigade, Sec- 
ond Division, Eighteenth Army Corps, serving in many different brigades 
and several corps. He was discharged at Columbus. Kentuckv. April 26, 
1864, on account of physical ability, and returned home to take u]5 the duties 
of private life, which had been temporarily abandoned for those of patriotism. 

Smith Bilderback and Martha R. Stretch were united in the holv bonds 



2(o BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

of matrimony on March 5. 1842. She was a daughter of Isaac Stretch, a 
blacksmith of AUoway Creek, who diefl at the age of thirty-six years. They 
had three children: Mortimer, who was born April 23, 1844, and died July 
3, 1848: Edmund Smith, who was born September i. 1853, and was drowned 
in Salem creek August 4, 1862; and Martha Virginia, who was born January 
12, 1861, and who married the Rev. Edwin H. Bronson, the pastor of Block- 
ley Baptist church in Philadelphia. Their children are William Paul, de- 
ceased. Katharine Virginia. Vera Millicent and Phillip Elliot. The Rev. 
Bronson passed to his re\\ard Julv 9, 1889, since which time his widow has 
made her home with her father and been employed as a teacher in the public 
schools. After returning from the war he engaged in the whiting and pressing 
business at Salem. He is not now in active business. His honesty and in- 
tegrity are beyond cjuestion. He was a Democrat before the war, but has 
since found the Republican principles to conform more nearly to his views of 
right. He has served in a number of local oflices: was the clerk of the town- 
ship of Alloway Creek, three years, the constable for that township, tax collec- 
tor, member of the board of freeholders three years, and in 1850 was elected 
to the state legislature. In August, 1856, he came to Salem and served as 
freeholder four years. He was also a trustee of the county almshouse and 
represented Salem on the lioard in 1888-9 'i"'' from 1891 to 1899. He is also 
a zealous member of the Baptist church, in which he has Ijeen both deacon 
and trustee. Fraternally he belongs to the Knights of Pythias and the Inde- 
pendent Order of Odd Fellows. He is also a member of Johnson Post, G. A. 
R., No. 69, with which he united fifteen years ago, and has filled all the ofifices 
in the gift of the organization. He takes the greatest interest in all the affairs 
of the Grand Army of the Republic, attending the state meetings, depart- 
ments, encampments, etc. He is a genial, pleasant gentleman whose life has 
been filled with interesting data, and it is a privilege as well as pleasure to 
hear him recount some of the interesting features as he recalls them. 



JAMES MONROE CHESTER, 

The ancestors of this gentleman came to Cape May county during colon- 
ial days and the name has since figured prominently in connection with the 
annals of this section of the state. It is easy to picture the paternal great- 
grandfather, Joseph Chester, in the colonial dress of the period, superintend- 
ing his farm of three hundred acres, the place being operated with the primi- 
tive implements in use at the time. He was born in Eldora, Cape May 
county, and throughout his life was a gentleman farmer, winning through

the cultivation of the fields a comfortable competence. He gave his political 
support to the Democracv. an.l was an adherent of the Methodist Episcopal 
church. Both he and his wife died when eightv years of age. The grand- 
father of our subject was born in Dennis township. Cape May county, and for 
several years was a sea captain, commanding vessels engaged in the coast- 
ing trade. At the time of his death he resided in Goshen. Indiana, and durmg 
the war of 1812 he served as a member of the home guard. In early man- 
hood he gave his support to the old-time Republican party, hi which Jefferson 
and others were leaders. Later he supported the principles ot the then newly 
organized Democratic party, and in religious belief he was a Methodist, con- 
tinuing his allegiance to the faith in which he had been reared. He was 
twice married and by the first union had three ch.ildren.— John. Mary .\. and 
Richard, the last named becoming the husband of Eliza Conover. The 
mother of these children died and the father afterward married Man- Rig- 
ains The children of the second union were William, a sea captain who 
married Jane Thompson and had four children,— Melvin. Adeline. Julia and 
Euphrates: James, the second of the family: Eleanor, who l^ecame the wife 
of Rural Feister. a farmer, and their children were John. ^lary J., Elizabeth 
and Kate: Charles, who married Sallie Hawkins and made farming his hfe 
work: Reuben. Jeremiah and Samuel, who never married: and Mary, who 
liecame the wife of Thomas H. Swain, a sea captain residing at Goshen, and 
their children were Florence. Lizzie. Sallie. Hattie. Edward and Lilly. The 
paternal grandfather of our subject died at the age of seventy-four years. 

James Chester, the father of the subject of this sketch, was born De- 
cember 23. 1825. obtaining his education in the common schools of Cape 
May countv ancl for thirty-five years followed the sea. being engaged in the 
coasting trade. He owned three vessels, including the George E. Brown. 
He also engaged in cutting and shipping cord-wood and cedar and plain 
lumber. A ^zealous Republican in politics, he has ever taken a deep interest 
in the growth and success of his party. Long a member of the ^Lasonic 
fraternity, he formerly af^filiated with Cannon Lodge, at Seaville. and after- 
ward became connected with Arbutus Lodge at Cape May Court House. 
He is also an honorary member of the Order of Mechanics. During the civil 
war he served for nine months in the Union army, enlisting in Company I, 
Twenty-fifth New Jersey Lifantry. in 1862. The regiment was assigned to

The maternal ancestry of Mr. Chester is equally ancient and honorable. 
His great-grandfather on his mother's side was an Englishman, who on 
leaving the "merrie isle" located at Port Elizaljeth. New Jersey, where he was 
connected with the trading interests as a sea captain. He had two children. 
— Samuel and Loretta, the latter the wife of Thomas Ferguson, a retired

Mr. Chester, resided in Cumberland county. New Jersey, where he followed 
the occupation of farming. His political ballot was cast in support of the 
Republican party. He married Martha Hewett and their children were Wal- 
ter, Mary, Sallie, Loretta, Alfred. Hezekiah, Lorenzo, Bella, Hattie and

gaged in the milk business for four years, and for five years efficiently served 
as postmaster at Sea Isle City. At the expiration of that period he came to 
Ocean City and engaged in the real-estate business, and he has been con- 
nected with some of the most important realty transfers that have been made 
here. He buys, sells and improves property and has erected a number of 
residences. He has purchased as many as one hundred and eighty lots, and 
in connection with Joseph I. Scull he purchased four hundred and eighty-six 
acres of land lying between Carson's Inlet, the Atlantic .ocean and Carson's

and Miss Julia H. Duvall. a daughter of Edward Duvall. of Ocean View, 
a well known ovster planter, and their union has been blest with three chil- 
dren" Arthur B.. Ralph L. and Genevra Julia. Mr. Chester is a member 
of Ocean Citv Lodge. No. 171. F. & A. M.. and of the Odd Fellows' society. 
He votes with the Republican party, and the confidence reposed in him by 
his fellow townsmen is indicated by the fact that he served as a member of 
the city council of Sea Isle City and has been the president of the council at 
Ocean' City. The volume and importance of the business is an indication of 
his high standing in commercial circles and tells of his useful and active life. 
All thlit he has he has acquired through his own efforts, making the most of 
his possibilities and utilizing the opportunities which surround his path. 



LEWIS S. CHESTER. 



Lewis Samuel Chester was born November 22. 1863, at Goshen, Cape 
May county, is a son of James and Mary A. (Jones) Chester and a brother of 
James Monroe Chester, in connection with whose history on other pages of 
this work is given the lineage of our subject. Mr. Chester acquired his lit- 
erary education in the public schools of his native town, also attended Hart's 
grammar school in Philadelphia, and prepared for his business career in 
Brvant & Stratton's Business College. On putting aside his text-books in 
1882 he came to Sea Isle City, at which time the place contained only fifty 
houses. Here he opened a grocery store and has since engaged in business 
along that line. He has also devoted his energies to the management of 
real-estate transfers and owned considerable property. He is a member of 
the Sea Isle Building & Loan Association and is accounted one of the leading 
factors in commercial circles. He has been called to public office by the 
vote of the people and has rendered most effective service in the position of 
collector and treasurer, where he served for nine years. On the ist of Oc- 
tober, 1898, he was appointed postmaster of Sea Isle City, in which position 
he is administering the business with promptness and ability. He has ever 
been an adherent of the Republican principles, and his belief in the party 
prompts his active and energetic effort in its behalf. He has been a delegate 
to the various county and congressional conventions and is a recognized 
leader in Republican ranks.

EDWARD HICKS PHILLIPS, AI. D. 

For almost a third of a century Dr. Phillips has engaged in the practice of 
medicine in Cape May, — a period in which there has been ample time and 
opportunity to test his ability in various departments of the profession, and 
that he holds rank among the leading practitioners of the county stands in 
evidence of his skill. From the beginning his patronage has steadily in- 
creased until he is now the attending physician in many of the best house- 
holds of Cape May and the surrounding country, and from his large practice 
he has derived a good income. 

The Doctor was born in Middletown township, at Neshaminy Falls, Bucks 
county, Pennsylvania, April 7, 1832, and is a son of Robert and Naomi (Gar- 
rison) Phillips. He is descended from English ancestry, who were connected 
with the Society of Friends, the family having been founded in America by 
two brothers, Thomas and John Phillips, who crossed the Atlantic, the former 
taking up his abode in Salisbury township, Bucks county, while the latter 
became a resident of Mercer county. New Jersey. The Doctor is of the fifth 
generation from Thomas Phillips. His grandfather, Thomas Phillips, was born 
in Salisbury township, Bucks county, and there operated a gristmill for many 
years. He was a member of the Hicksite Society of Friends, attending the 
Salisbury meeting. He wedded Mary Eastburn, and to them were Ijorn the 
following children: Moses, Aaron, Thomas, David, Robert, Rachel, Mary, 
Mercia and one son who died in early manhood, being frozen to death while 
going to his business one morning. The father of these children died in 
February, 1840, at the age of seventy years, and his wife passed away in 
1836, at the age of seventy. 

The Doctor's father, Robert Phillips, was born in Salisbury township. 
Bucks county, Pennsylvania, June i, 1797, and with his father learned the 
miller's trade. He afterward operated a mill in the state of New York, later 
carried on the same business in Trenton, New Jersey, and subsequently in 
Lambertsville, New Jersey, where he conducted the Pine Hope Mill. He 
then began the operation of a mill at Neshaminy Falls, Pennsylvania, and on 
selling that property removed to Byberry township, Philadelphia county. 
where he built a mill, which he operated until 1846. He then sold out and 
started westward. He made his wav to Chicago and soon afterward r)ur-

perance and overthrow the liquor traflfic. In politics he was formerly a Re- 
publican and his first presidential vote was cast for John P. Hale, the candi- 
date of the Free-soil party. He now exercises his right of franchise in support 
of the Prohibition party, which embodies his ideas on the temperance ques- 
tion. He is a member of the Swedenborgian church at the corner of Twenty- 
second and Chestnut streets, Philadelphia, and at all times he lends his sup- 
port to those interests which tend to uplift humanity and improve the con- 
ditions of life. Honorable and upright, he commands the respect of all witli 
whom he comes in contact, his kindly manner and helpful spirit winning him 
manv friends. 



R. HOWARD THORN. 



This gentleman is now the efficient postmaster at Ocean City, and is in 
control of one of the most extensive enterprises at that place. Through the 
passing years he has added to his capital by the careful conduct of his mer- 
cantile interests and enlarged his facilities to meet the demands of the con- 
stantly increasing trade, thus becoming the proprietor of one of the largest 
business houses in the city which he makes his home. 

Mr. Thorn was born at Frankford, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 23, 
1857, his parents being Richard H. and Rebecca (Shallcross) Thorn. Seven 
brothers by the name of Thorn came to America at an early period in the 
history of this country. One of the brothers settled in Salem county. New 
Jersey, the second in Maryland, and John Thorn, the original ancestor of our 
subject, took up his abode in Chesterfield township, Burlington county. 
New Jersey, where he followed the occupation of farming. James came over 
with Lord Baltimore. The grandfather of our subject also bore the name of 
John, and was born at Crosswicks, Burlington county, in 1790. He was 
educated in the schools of Bordentown, learned the potter's trade, and en- 
gaged in the manufacture of pottery in Crosswicks in early life, but subse- 
quently removed to Frankford, Philadelphia, where he manufactured all 
kinds of earthenware. There he spent his remaining days, his death occur- 
ring in March. 1857, at the age of sixty-seven years. His political support

and in 1887 he bought two adjoining lots and enlarged his store by build- 
ing upon them. At different times he made additions and improvements in 
his store until the Thorn Block is now seventy-eight by sixty feet, and three 
stories in height. The large store building in which the postoftice is now

GENERAL W.\RREX P. EDGARTOX. 

The story of but few lives is more replete with interest, daring courage 
and distinguished service than is that of General Warren P. Edgarton. who. 
alike in the varied fields of literature, militan*- life, law and conspicuous public 
office, has shown marked ability and rare executive powers. His is another 
case of a New Englander called into the most arduous and responsible posi- 
tions and everywhere being found fully equal to the occasion. 

A native of Harvard, Massachusetts, born May 16, 1836, the son of John 
and Mary (Hayden) Edgarton. he was reared in the shadow of Harvard Uni- 
versity, and from early years evinced the tastes of a student. His ancestors 
were prominent participants in the early battles of the Revolution, and did 
well their part on the historic battle fields of Concord and Lexington. Gen- 
eral Edgarton descends from the old English family of Egertons (as the name 
was formerly spelled) which first appeared in this country as residents of 
East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, the same town where dwelt the ancestors 
of William Cullen Bryant. "There was an Edgarton at Saybrook as early 
as 1645." The paternal great-grandfather of General Edgarton was John 
Edgarton. his grandfather was Leonard Edgarton and his father also John 
Edgarton. The latter was also a native of Harvard and followed the voca- 
tions of contracting and building. He did life's duty well and died in 1897. 
at a hale old age. His wife died many years ago. in 1861. Three of their four 
children are now living. 

General Edgarton. after the advantage of Harvard schools, took a train- 
ing course at the New England Normal School at Lancaster. Massachusetts, 
and then engaged in teaching. He was the professor of oratory and rhetoric 
at the Hudson River Institute and Claverack College at Claverack, New 
York, before he was twenty, and the author of an educational work of merit. 
"The New York Speaker." published in 1856. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 271 

Becoming early convinced that the west was the place for a young man of 
ability, he located on the Western Reserve in Ohio in 1855 or '6. He studied 
law and was admitted to the bar in Cleveland in 1859. In 1 861, at the break- 
ing out of the civil war, he was the professor of the law of contracts and of 
pariiamentarv and forensic oratory in the Ohio State College of Law at 
Cleveland, and also special lecturer at President Garfield's famous school at 
Hiram. Ohio. He had also written and published several books on law and 
elocution. When loyal patriots were responding to the nation's call for brave 
defenders, the pursuits of law and literature lost their charm for the young 
professor and he volunteered as a private soldier. From this time his upward 
course was rapid. The historian of the Second Division of the Army of the 
Cumberland says, in a biographical foot note, of the General's connection 
with that distinguished organization: 

"Upon the president's call for troops, in April, 1861. General Edgarton 
enlisted as a private in Colonel James Barnett's battery of artillery and served 
in every engagement of ]\IcClellan's campaign in western Virginia. His 
term of enlistment having expired, he was commissioned to raise a battery 
of artillery. In less than three weeks he enlisted one hundred and fifty men. 
who were' mustered into the service as Batterv- E, First Ohio Light Artillery. 
It was assigned to General O. M. Mitchell's division, and participated with 
that command in all its arduous and brilliant campaigns in middle Tennessee 
and northern Alabama, ^\'hen his battery was attached to the second divi- 
sion he was appointed the chief of artillery and sen-ed in that honorable 
position until the memorable battle of Stone River. Of his heroic action 
and capture enough has been said in the text. In June, 1863, he returned 
to his command and was appointed chief of artillery at the post of Nashville. 
When the reserve troops moved to the front just previous to the battle of 
Chickamauga he was relieved from his post at Nashville upon his own request 
and made chief of artillery upon General Morgan's staff. Five weeks later he 
was assigned to a similar position on the staff of General Sheridan. During 
the first and second days of the battle of ?^Iission Ridge he commanded the 
guns of Fort Negley at Chattanooga. On the morning of the third day he took 
the field. Stationing two regular batteries on Orchard Knob he directed 
their fire upon the enemy on Mission Ridge until our own troops came within 
range: then, mounting his horse, he dashed to the front, joining General 
Sheridan just in time to participate in the capture of Bragg's headquarters. 
When the Fourth Army Corps hastened to the relief of Burnside at Knox- 
ville, he was placed in charge of the artillery accompanying the expedition. 
On the loth of :March he was promoted major of artillery."

31, 1862, resulted in his capture l^y the Confederates and his confinement 
in Libby prison for five montlis. His later military service was in complete 
unison with that detailed above, and he retired from the army with the rank of 
brevet-brigadier general. This long and hazardous service in the campaigns 
of the war, and the deprivations and sufferings of his prison life at Libljy. 
nearlv wrecked a wonderfully strong physical organization, and at the close 
of the war he sought recuperation in country life at Newfield, Gloucester 
county, New Jersey, where he purchased a farm which is still his home. 

After partially regaining his health he visited the principal countries of 
Europe, and while in Scotland was made a Master Mason in Caledonia Lodge. 
No. 392, of Edinburg. with which he is now afifiHated. After his return to 
America General Edgarton was for a time engaged in railroad building in 
Arkansas, and in 1872 was appointed by Postmaster General Creswell assist- 
ant superintendent of the United States Railway mail service and special 
agent of the United States post-oiifice department. His was just the nature 
to grapple with the numerous difificulties and dangers connected with these 
offices, and with the exception of two years of President Cleveland's admin- 
istration he was twenty-seven years in office, resigning his position on March 
9, 1899. He was first located at Little Rock, Arkansas, in charge of a division 
which included Arkansas, Texas and the Indian Territory. His headquarters 
were later transferred to Cincinnati, and later still to St. Louis, where he was 
chief of a division which emliraced eight states of the southwest, and here 
thirty inspectors were subject to his orders. The healthful results of his 
labors in these fields and his success in organization, together with his admin- 
istrative ability, caused him to be transferred to New England, where, with 
his headquarters at Boston, he was the chief of the six New England states. 
During President Harrison's administration and that of President AIcKinley 
he was stationed at Philadelphia in charge of the service in Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey. 

During his official career he visited and made friends in every state in the 
Union. A competent authority has said, "His work is among the highest in 
his branch of the service." He was e\er found accurate, reliable, faithful to 
the minor as well as major duties of service, and at all times was counted an 
"invaluable" member of this responsible force. A stalwart Republican in pol- 
itics and a brilliant public speaker, and for many years a reliable campaigner 
in heated political years, he has yet won and retained the friendship of his 
opponents to a surprising extent by his fairness, his courtesy and his kindly 
consideration of the rights of others.

the consciousness of having done long years of faithful service to the hearty 
satisfaction of his superiors, and with the satisfaction of numbering among 
his familiar friends the leaders in a period of the highest importance to the 
prosperity of the nation, including such men as Rosecrans, Sheridan, Sher- 
man. Grant. Garfield and numerous others whose memories are endeared to 
and revered by every lover of his country. And not only these, but the com- 
rades of the Grand Army of the Repuljlic. in which he is prominent, are 
equallv liis friends. 

In civil life he is considered as a gentleman of rare accomplishments and 
culture, whom it is a pleasure to know and to associate with, and here also he 
numbers his friends by legions. The lessons of his life are well worthy of care- 
ful perusal by the young men of the period who are desirous of serving their 
country faithfully and well. 



ANDREW SINNICKSON. 

Andrew Sinnickson. a retired lawyer of Salem, is one of the best known 
men in the county, and is descended, through a long line of prominent ances- 
tors, from one Sinnich Sinnichsen. who lived in Denmark in 1550 and was 
ennobled by King Frederick II. of that country, and given the possession 
of Hestrip, Angela. Denmark. About fifty years later this property passed 
into the hands of his son. Carlen. 

Andrew Sinnichsen. a son of Carlen. came to America with the first 
Swedish emigrants about 1627 and located along the Delaware river, after- 
ward moving to New Jersey, where he purchased a large tract of land, in 
1645, in what is now Lower Penn's Neck township. Some thirty years later, 
when John Fenwick came to this country to take possession of his tenth. 
Andrew secured a quit-claim to the tract in consideration of a vearly pay- 
ment of three shillings. Two sons came with him to his new home. Andrew 
and Broor, the latter having located in Delaware. Andrew, the remaining 
son and the fourth of the name, came to this state, where he married and 
reared a family. One of his sons, Andrew the fourth, was born in 1718, in 
Lower Penn's Neck township, and became one of the most prominent men 
of his time, being judge of the court of common pleas, deputy to the provin- 
cial congress of the state and a member of the first legislative council. By 
his strong opposition to British tyranny he called dow-n upon his head the 
vituperations of that nation as did also his son. Thomas, who was a promi- 
nent statesman and business man of Salem, and for whose capture, either dead 
or ali\e. the British general. Lord Howe, offered one hundred pounds, ster-

ling. Andrew Sinnickson was united in marriage with Miss Sarah Giljohn- 
son, who was born in 1756. His large estate was divided after his death, 
August 20, 1790, among his large famil)- of children. (The spelling of the 
:iame has been changed.) 

Andrew Sinnickson (5th) was born on the old homestead in 1749. He 
was a captain of the Salem militia, First Battalion, and paymaster for Salem, 
Cumberland and Cape May. He was brave and fearless and the special 
object against which the hatred of the red-coats was directed. A foraging 
party of the British made an assault on his property on March 20, 1778, but 
were repulsed in such a manner they were glad to escape without their 
booty. He took unto himself four wives in his life-time, — Margaret Bilder- 
back; Margaret Johnson, born August 2, 1756, and died November 4, 1792: 
Sarah Capner, widow of Andrew Sinnickson, a distant cousin; and Sarah 
Norris. 

Thomas Sinnickson was born in the same township as were his ancestors, 
December 13, 1786. He was one of the most prominent Federalists of his 
age and was afterward a powerful factor in the ranks of the Whig and Re- 
publican forces. He was the presiding judge of the court of common pleas, 
judge of the court of errors and appeals of New Jersey, a member of the legis- 
lature and of the twentieth national congress. He settled many estates and was 
guardian and administrator of more estates than any man in the county. 
He was a vestryman and a warden of St. John's Episcopal church and a man 
who was universally respected and esteemed. October 18, 1810, he was 
united in the holy bonds of matrimony with Elizabeth, daughter of John and 
Mary (Brinton) Jacobs, of Chester county, Pennsylvania. She was born 
August 3, 1786, and died August 19, 1849. Thomas Sinnickson died Febru- 
ary 17, 1873. Their children were Dr. John Jacobs, deceased; Margaret 
Johnson (Mrs. Thomas Jones Yorke), born January 26, 1814; Charles and 
Andrew. 

Andrew Sinnickson was born October 2y, 1817, at Salem, where he re- 
ceived his primary education in the private schools. This was supplemented 
by a course in the Burlington Boarding School, after which he took up the 
study of law, with Alphonso L. Aiken, of Salem, for his preceptor, later with 
ex-Governor Peter D. Vroom, of Trenton, for his tutor, and was admitted to 
the bar in 1842. He at once opened an ofifice in this city and in a short time 
had established a large and lucrative clientage. He continued in the practice 
of his chosen profession until 1879, when he retired from practice. He was 
the prosecuting attorney for Salem county for ten years and gave his best 
efforts toward eradicating the evils that existed there. 

In 1859 he was united in marriage with Miss Louisa, daughter of 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEJV JERSEY. 275 

Ephraim Booth, of Reading, Pennsylvania. They had three children: 
Louise, the wife of Norman Gray, a lawyer of Camden, this state: Bessie, who 
died just as she was blossoming into womanhood: and an infant who died 
unnamed. Mr. Sinnickson is a member of St. John's Episcopal church, in 
which he is a warden, and is a strong Republican, although he has never 
cared to enter the political arena. He was a charter member of the Eenwick 
Club, of this city, and is a member of the Sons of the Revolution. He is 
largely interested in real estate and owns sex'eral farms in Lower Penn's Neck 
tovrnship, besides other farms. He is a business man of ability and has lieen 
chosen time and again to administer on estates. 



JOHN F. GR.\HAM. 



One of the most popular young business men of Woodbury, Gloucester 
county, is John Foster Graham, the genial cashier of the First National Bank. 
He is a native of the city of "brotherly love," his birth having occurred during 
the progress of the civil war, on the loth of March, 1862. He thus is in the 
prime of manhood and possesses the enthusiasm and i^rogressive spirit which 
characterizes the American citizen of his generation. 

The early education of our subject was such as the excellent public schools 
of his native city afforded, and after completing his studies he was employed 
in a law of^ce for three years. In 1878 he entered the Commonwealth Na- 
tional Bank of Philadelphia, in a clerical capacity, and continued in that well 
known institution of finance for four years. Having thus liecome perfectly 
familiar with the banking business, he accepted a more paying position with 
the Mechanics' National Bank of Philadelphia, being assistant to the receiv- 
ing teller for a short time and later lieing promoted to the position of discount 
clerk. He remained with this bank until 1892, when he resigned, in order to 
accept his present place, which he has filled most creditably and to tlie full 
satisfaction of its officials, as well as to that of the general public. 

The same year that Mr. Graham l)ecame connected with tlie First Na- 
tional Bank of Woodbury he led to the marriage altar Miss Mary Magill, a 
daughter of William J. and Elizabeth (Wallace) Magill. The ceremony 
which united their destinies was performed in Philadelphia, April 9, 1892. 
Their only child, a little daughter, who was christened Elizabeth Magill, died 
when but five weeks old. 

Socially Mr. Graham stands \ery high, ])eing a member and master of 
the exchequer of Mariola Lodge, anrl identified with the Knights of Pythias

ISAAC H. VANNEMAN. 

Isaac Hendrickson X'annenian. the president of the Swedesboro National 
Bank, has been one of the most prominent factors in the growth and develop- 
ment of Swedesboro, in the vicinity of w-hich town his entire life has been 
passed. He is the grandson of Isaac Vanneman, who was an early settler 
of Woolwich tow^nship, Gloucester county, and had one daughter and five 
sons. Of the latter. Helms, who was the father of our subject, was married 
three times. His first wife was Mary Black, and the second Mary Homan. 
neither of whom had any children. His third wife. Mary Hendrickson. bore 
him eight children, of whom the following record is given: Hannah, de- 
ceased, married Daniel Lynch, and became the mother of nine children; 
John died in 1856. at the age of forty-two years: Ann died at the age of 
eightv _\-ears: Charles and Helms, twins, died when about seventy years 
old; Isaac H. is the next; Mary, widow- of Dr. John F. r^Iusgrave. resides 
in Sw'cdesboro: and Sarali also lives in that town. 

Isaac H. Vanneman was born September 15, 1826. on a farm about two 
miles from Swedesboro. and followed agricultural pursuits until 1865, when 
he took up his residence in the town. He has been the owner of several 
farms, at various times, and at present owns two. After his removal to 
Swedesboro he was for three years the treasurer of the Woodbury & Swedes- 
boro Railroad. He was one of the organizers of the branch and one of its 
directors until it Ijecame a part of the Pennsylvania system. He also assisted 
in the organization of the Building & Loan Association and is its treasurer. 
In addition to the aliove he has numerous other interests, and to his energy 
and progressive spirit the tow-n owes much of its prosperity. 

Mr. Vanneman was married March 6, 1862, to Marietta Hewes, a 
daughter of Thomas and Rebecca (Black) Hewes. of Woolwich township. 
Thev have had five children: Sarah Emma, who died in childhood; Revilla, 
the wife of William R. Poinsett, of Swedesboro; Anna, who died at the age 
of two years; Mary H., the wife of George B. Mitchell, of Swedesboro, by 
whom she has two children, Marian and Helen; and Emma, at home. 

For twenty years Mr. Vanneman has been one of the vestrymen of the 
Protestant Episcopal church of Swedesboro, and was chosen warden in 1899. 
He was one of the organizers of the Swedesboro grange, of which he was the 




'^^^2-^lylylA-.^,yZ'Z<,^?C^C<^

treasurer for many years, and has also assisted in forming many of the neigh- 
Ijoring granges. In politics he is a lifelong Republican and has held numerous 
township offices. He is a man who has always had the welfare of his fellow- 
men at heart, and he has given willingly of his time and money to promote 
social intercourse, improv^e the moral and physical conditions, and enlarge the 
business facilities of his comnnmity. 

Trinity Episco]3al church, which inmibers among its members many of 
the leading citizens of S\vedesl)oro and \icinity. was at first a Swedish mission 
of the Wilmington (Delaware) church, and was chartered b\- King George 
III. in 1765. Two log buildings near Raccoon creek i:)receded the present 
brick structure, which was erected in 1784. At this date the church was 
under the charge of Dr. Nicholas Collins, who came from Sweden in 1770 
and occasionally ministered at Raccoon and Penn's Neck. He began his 
pastorate in 1778, and continued over the pari.sh until 1786. In one of the 
old parish records is found a brief statement of his work at the points men- 
tioned: "At Swedesboro I Perform divine service every third Sunday dur- 
ing the summer and autumn of 1786." This rectorship is notalile as being 
the last in which the parish had any recognized relation to the church of 
Sweden, and also for the erection of the building which has been used for 
one hundred years. From 1778 to 1884 the church had twenty ])astors. In 
1838 a tower and steeple were built, a bell w as purchased, and manv impro\e- 
ments made in the interior of the building. In 1844 the old parsonage was 
moved and sold, and a new one was built, which was afterward enlarged and 
repaired. In 185 1 the present slate roof was placed upon the church build- 
ing. In 1852 a new musical instrument, called the aeolian, was purchased. 
It is still in use, and in the care of Mr. Henry Shivler, who for thirty years was 
the secretary of the vestry. In 1854 the present Sunday-school and lecture 
room was built, and the interior of the church was renovated. In 1859 the 
old bell was sold and a new one purchased. The church is an historical land- 
mark, and it history in full is most interesting. At the present time it is in-a 
flourishing condition.

S. P. DE HART. 



S. P. De Hart, of W'illiamstown. was born February 12. 1842. on a farm 
which is still his home, and is the only living child of CorneHus and Hannah 
(Prickett) De Hart. His father was bom at Evesham. Xew Jersey, and was 
a son of Jacob De Hart, who was of French descent. The great-grandfather 
of our subject was the owner of extensive property interests at Evesham, 
which w ere destroyed by the British during the war of the Revolution. He 
afterward settled at Cross Ke\"s. Gloucester county, where the representa- 
tives of his family have since remained. Cornelius De Hart w as a farmer by 
occupation and was a leading member and exhorter of the Methodist Epis- 
copal church. He died in 1869, and his wife, who was a daughter of John 
Prickett. died in 1882. 

S. P. De Hart, their only surviving child, acquired his education in the 
common schools, his attendance alternating with work on the farm. From 
his youth he displayed excellent musical ability and his correct ear and love 
for the art of music led him into the business of tuning pianos and organs. 
In 1872 he began to sell pianos and organs and now has a trade extending 
over four counties. He buys from the factory and sells direct to the people. 
He is now enjoying a liberal patronage, having established a good business. 
He is also the owner of seventy-five acres of land, which he cultivates. 

Mr. De Hart was united in marriage to Miss Parnella Sickler, of this local-

from that country, and was a prominent and influential citizen of Gloucester 
county. He was a local preacher and also a justice of the peace. The mar- 
riage of Mr. and Mrs. De Hart was celebrated in 1865. and has been blessed 
with two children: Allie, the wife of L. Dorst Hurfif, of Wenonah; and 
Mary, the wife of Sumner Crist, at home. 

For four terms Mr. De Hart has served as a member of the township 
committee, has been school trustee for nine years and was the clerk of the 
town for six years. He votes with the Republican party and takes quite an 
acti\'e interest in politics, doing all in his power to promote the growth and 
insure the success of the organization with which he is connected. He also 
labors zealously in behalf of his friends on election days. He has used his 
musical talent for the benefit of the church, having been leader of the choir of 
the Methodist Episcopal church for twenty years, while for four years he 
has led the singing in the Sunday-school. Such in brief is the history of one 
whose entire life has been passed in Gloucester county, and who in its various 
relations has stood by every measure that he believed was for public benefit. 
In manner he is cordial and genial, and not only wins friends wherever he 
goes but also has the happy faculty of drawing them closer to him as the 
years pass by. 



JOSEPH G. CHAMPION. 

Joseph G. Champion was born February 24, 1865, in Morristown, New- 
Jersey, and is a son of Lorenzo Dow- and Harriett (Rain) Champion. His 
great-great-grandfather was Nathaniel Champion, the first of the name to 
seek a home in Cape May county. He lived and died in Tuckahoe, wdiere he 
carried on agricultural pursuits. Lorenzo D. Champion, the father of our 
subject, w-as born in Tuckahoe and in early life learned the shoemaker's trade. 
He followed that vocation many years and was long connected with Isaac 
Smashey, a shoe manufacturer at Salem, New Jersey. He afterward re- 
moved to Rio Grande, Cape May county, w here he engaged in farming, but 
is now living a retired life in Palermo. He married Miss Rain and the three 
children born to them are Joseph G. ; C. Leslie, who married Lizzie Driver,

Cape May county and at the age of twenty years had acquired a good practi- 
cal knowledge of those branches of learning which fit one for the responsible

duties of business life. He afterward learned tlie trade of milling and also the 
carpenter's trade, which he followed for five years as a journeyman. In 
1892 he began contracting and building at Ocean City and has since been 
connected with all important industrial interests. He has also studied archi- 
tecture and his great capability in this line has enabled him to add largely to 
the attractive appearance of the town in which he resides. He was the archi- 
tect for the Bourse building, the Sentinel Printing House and a number of 
hotels, and on all sides stand beautiful residences, representing all kinds of 
architecture which are the work of this well known contractor. He is con- 
nected with E. W. Burleigh & Company, dealers in building supplies, and is 
the head of the firm of Joseph Champion & Company, contractors and build- 
ers, who employ more men than any other contracting firm in Ocean City 
and have erected more buildings than any one connected with this line. 

Mr. Champion exercises his right of franchise in support of the men and 
measures of the Republican party and has been a candidate for mayor in 
Ocean City. He is identified with the Improved Order of Red Men in Cam- 
den; with Iota Council, No. 6, J. O. U. A. M., and the American Order of 
United Workmen. He is also a member of the Engine Company. No. 2. of 
the volunteer fire department. He contributes to the support of the Meth-

married November 25, 1897, to Gertrude, a daughter of John Carpenter, of 
Salem county, then residing in Pennsville. They have one child, named 
Anna B. He has since been located in this section. Mr. Champion is identi- 
fied with the social, material and moral progress of Ocean City and is a lead- 
ing and influential man. As an architect and builder he has done much to 
improve the appearance of this most attractive summer resort and has been 
an active factor in the work which has assured the successful future of the 
town. 



JOSEPH RULON BLACK. 

The Black family has been for many years one of the leading families of 
Gloucester county. New Jersey. About 1750 three brothers — Thomas. 
Samuel and William Black — came from county Antrim, Ireland, and settled 
in Gloucester county. William afterward returned to Ireland; and Samuel. 
who made his home with his brother Thomas, was never married; so that all 
the family are descended from Thomas. During the Revolutionary war he 
was obliged to pass much of his time concealed in the woods on account of 
the frequent visits of the British soldiers to the homes of the settlers, whom. 
when they found, they took prisoners. Upon one of these occasions he was 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 281 

at home but took refuge in the loft of his house, which was reached by a lad- 
der. As the soldiers were about to ascend to his hiding place his wife told 
them that her husband was not up there, but that her children were, and 
sleeping, and asked that they be not disturbed. Perhaps it was the tender 
recollections of his own little ones at home, or it may have been a natural 
reluctance to disturb the slumbers of babyhood, — at any rate, the command- 
mg officer did not order his men up the ladder, and the life of one Revolu- 
tionary patriot, the founder of a family which has produced many good citi- 
zens, was saved. 

The children of Thomas Black were: Elizabeth, who married Thomas 
Logan; Frances, who married Thomas Leap; Benjamin, who was for many 
vears a farmer in Gloucester county; Samuel, who married Keziah Vanlear; 
and it is thought that William and Sarah were by a second wife. The chil- 
dren of Samuel and Keziah (Vanlear) Black were: Thomas, who was a far- 
mer near Swedesboro; Elizabeth, who married William Gaskill; George: 
Samuel: Mary, who never married and is now ninety-three years of age; 
Alexander, who married Hannah Ivulon; Rebecca, who married Thomas B. 
Hewes; and Beulah, who died young. The children of Alexander and Han- 
nah (Rulon) Black were: David, who lives in Swedesboro; Joseph R., the 
direct subject of this sketch; Marianna, who married John C. Rulon; Lucretia, 
who lives with her brother Joseph R.; Henrietta, Caroline, Beulah and Sum- 
ner, who died in childhood; and Emma, who married Walter S. Bassett. a 
farmer near Swedesboro. 

Joseph R. Black was born on a farm situated along Raccoon creek, about 
three miles from Swedesboro, August 24, 1833, and was educated in the 
public schools of his native township and at Wilmington, Delaware, and 
Norristown, Pennsylvania. He has followed farming all his life, except 1861 
to 1865, when he was engaged in the undertaking business in Philadelphia. 
In 1884 he purchased his present comfortable residence and removed to 
Swedesboro, but still owns the old homestead fann and other farm property. 
Mr. Black was never married, but in his well appointed and modeiTi 
home, presided over by his sister, he enjoys the handsome competence which 
he has accumulated, and besides enjoying the comforts of home life he has 
taken much pleasure in numerous extended trips throughout the United 
States and Canada. Mr. Black was made a Mason in Mantua, New Jersey, 
and is a charter member of Swedesboro Lodge, No. 157, F. & A. M., which 
was organized in December, 1885. He is also a member of the Swedesljoro 
Grange, which was organized 1873. He is a Republican in politics and has 
been for thirty years a member of the grand jury of Gloucester county. 



282 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

AMXON WRIGHT. 

Amnon ^\ right enjoys the honor of ha\'ing' been the first settler at Cape 
May Point, New Jersey, and perhaps more than any other citizen here has 
been instrumental in the upbuilding of this now justly famous seaside resort. 
To his energy, enthusiasm and foresight many of the most substantial and 
beneficial improvements of the place are due. and in every possible manner he 
has repeatedly proved his intense local patriotism. 

The ancestors of Mr. Wright were English people who accompanied 
William Penn to America. At an early day they settled in Salem county. 
New Jersey, and from that time until the present the family has been num- 
bered among the reliable, prosperous citizens of this state. The paternal 
grandfather of our subject, W^illiam Wright, whose home was below Quinton 
and Alloway at Quinton's Bridge, Salem county, was considered a wealthy 
man in his day, as he owned property of value in that county, as well as in 
Cumberland county. He enlisted in the colonial army during the war of the 
Revolution and fought for the land of his birth, which he lived to see under 
an independent flag for several decades thereafter. By his first w-ife. Eliza- 
beth, four children were born, namely: Hezekiah, W^illiam. Hope, and 
James G. His second wife was a Miss Young in her girlhood. Death re- 
leased him from his earthly !al)ors in 1826. when he had attained the ripe age 
of four-score years. 

James G. Wright, the father of Amnon Wright, was born on the old 
homestead near Quinton's Bridge, in 1808, and as he grew to manhood he 
gave his attention to agriculture, also engaging in the lumber business on 
Alloway's creek. He was the owner of a large, desirable farm, and by dili- 
gence in business became well-to-do and respected. Politically he was a 
Democrat, but never accepted an official position. .An ardent Baptist, he 
contributed liberally to the work, and at his death left one thousand dollars 
to a church. This event occurred in 1880, when he was in his seventy-third 
year. His first wife, Hannah (Anderson) Wright, departed this life in 1863, 
when in her forty-ninth year, and left six children, namely: Amnon: Eben- 
ezer; Ann Elizabeth, wife of Samuel Halliday; Hannah Mary, wife of Joel 
Wilmuth, of Indiana; William, who wedded Mary Green, of Illinois, and is 
now living in Salem, Oregon; and Amanda, who never married. For a sec- 
ond wife James G. Wright chose Ann Banks, and their only child, Lillie, never 
married. 

The birth of Amnon \\'right took place on the parental homestead near 
Quinton's Bridge. March 25, 1835. After he had mastered the common 
branches taught in the public schools of the neighborhood he engaged in

HENRY J. FREAS. 



Henry J. Freas, deceased, was one of the substantial and most highly re- 
spected citizens of Salem, Salem county. New Jersey, and the eminence at- 
tained by him in the business world gaye eyidence of his shrewd perception 
and sound judgment in matters of business in no less a degree than his promi- 
nence in social and religious circles spoke of his kind and beneyolent nature. 
He was a son of Johnson F"reas and was born January- 20, 1845, at Penn's 
Neck, Salem county, Ne\y Jersey. His boyhood was similar to that of other 
lads of his time; his earlier years were spent in the private schools of Salem 
and he then became a clerk in the dry-goods store of Charles Rumsey, of that 
city. He remained in this position for several years, winning the confidence of 
the proprietor and customers alike, and making friends who were glad to 
assist the young man by their patronage and good w-ill when, at length, he 
embarked in his own dry-goods establishment. This step was taken in 1876. 
when he had just passed his majority, and was begun on a moderate scale, 
which was enlarged from time to time as the business demanded until at his 
death he had one of the best stocked stores in this vicinity. He purchasefl the 
George Garrison property, into which he moved his stock of goods and there 
he continued until his death, one of the most successful and jiopular mer- 
chants of Salem. His thrift and economy enabled him to lay by a consirler- 
able sum, which he invested judiciously from time to time as opportunity 
ofifered. and he became possessed of considerable property aside from his 
store. The sound common sense displayed by him in business transactions 
was used to no less advantage by him in domestic and social life, making 
his home one of the happiest and most attractive, and the center of a large 
circle of friends. He was a member of the Baptist church, to which he con- 
tributed liberally both of time and money. A Democrat in politics, he was 
tolerant of the views of others, and for eight years served on the board of 
education, and was also a member of the board of trade. 

He was married September 25, 1872, to Miss Elizabeth A. Hand, by 
whom he had four children, — Walter J., Francis Hand, Helen Cleaver and 
Alice Elizabeth. Mr. Freas died January 23, 1895. at the age of fifty years, 
when in the zenith of a successful life. Since his demise the business has been

carried on by Mrs. Freas and lier son Walter. The ability displayed by Mrs. 
Freas in this connection is something remarkable for a woman and excelled 
bv few men. As is often the case, the qualifications for a successful I:)usiness 
career were not suspected by the lady herself until the demand was made 
upon her to continue the large business of her husband's estate, and this she 
has done in a manner that has been a surprise to her friends and a credit to 
her sex. 

Jacob Freas was the founder of the family in this countrx'. He was born 
in 1715, in Friesland, Holland, and with his brother Phillip came to .\merica 
to seek a home. On board the same steamer was a young girl, an acquaint- 
ance of Jacob, Margaret Herkin, some eight years his junior. The acc[uaint- 
ance begun in the Fatherland was augmented by the close companionship 
aboard the vessel until it deepened into love, which was culminated in their 
marriage upon their arrival at Pennsyl\-ania. From Philadelphia they came 
to Salem county and settled at the location now known as Friesburg. Their 
children were Jacob, born October 14, 1741; Margaret, born February 5. 
1744; John, born March 26, 1746; Frederick, born October 12, 1748: George, 
bom September 3. 1750; Henry, born December 22, 1752; Mary, born March 
4, 1755, and drowned Januar\- 2, 1756; Phillip, born January 29, 1757: Peter, 
born July 29, 1759: and Elizabeth, born June 20. 1763. The wife and mother 
died July 30. 1770, at the age of fifty-one years, and a few years later Jacob 
Freas chose as his second helpmate Dorcas Halter, a widow, and their chil- 
dren were Mary, born February 22, 1776: Ann, born September i, 1777; 
Elizabeth, born August id, 1779: Margaret, born July 14, 1781 ; Phoebe, born 
May 25, 1783; and Sarah, born January i, 1786. Jacob Freas lived to a good 
old age, dying March 21, 1801, in his eighty-sixth year, a Lutheran, and was 
laid beside his wife. Margaret, in the Lutheran cemeterv at Friesliurg. New 
Jersey. 

Frederick Freas. one of his children, married Catherine Miller, a daughter 
of Peter and Barbara Miller and a granddaughter of John Michael Miller, 
who adxanced passage money to both Jacob and his wife when they came 
to America, and for whom they worked, after landing here, until the amount 
was repaid. Their children were Henry, born April 6. 1777; Elizabeth. Han- 
nah, Nancy, Lydia, Frederick and John. Henry married Hannah Ray. a 
daughter of Samuel and Hannah (Holmes) Ray. on June 22. 1802. The 
children b}- this union were Samuel. Ann, Louisiana. James, John. 
Henry, Johnson, William, Daniel, Reuben and Elizalieth. Judge Henr\- 
Freas. the grandfather of our subject, was one of the most prominent men of 
his time and took an active part in framing the laws of his state. He was 
elected to the ofiice of sheriff of Salem count\- in tSto. and at the joint meet- 



286 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

ings of the legislature held February 9, 1814. February 7. 1819. and October 
30, 1828, respectively, he was elected justice of the peace. He was 
elected Judge of the court in 1828 and again in 1833. He was a 
member of the legislature in 1813, 1826. and 1827, and a member of the 
legislative council in 1829 and 1831. During the war of 1812 he raised a 
company of volunteers, of which he was commissioned captain. Tliey were 
mustered in on September 27, 1814, and stationed at Billingsport, on the 
Delaware river, where they did good service in the defense of Philadel- 
phia during the three months thus situated. They were mustered out Decem- 
ber 21, 1814. He was a man of sterling worth who looked only to the inter- 
ests of his state when in the executive council, and was above the many petty 
considerations which influence many of the statesmen (so-called) of to-day. 
When in the senate he was one of two members who voted against legalizing 
horse-racing in the state of New Jersey. He was the president of the board 
of trustees of the First Baptist church of Salem, where he was an honored 
member for many years. His death occurred August i, 1856, when he was of 
the age of eighty years, and was universally mourned as a public calamity. 
He is well remembered by many of our older residents, and his career is a 
matter of personal and justifiable pride to his descendants.

early in life assisted his father in his outside business operations. For nine 
years he conducted a stage line from Cross Keys to Woodburj- and in all that 
time lost only twenty-six days from duty, except from sickness. He then 
conducted a stage line from Cross Keys to Grenloch for five years. His next 
venture was in the mercantile world, in which he engaged in selling farm 
implements and fertilizers and in which he has been very successful. He is 
energetic and enterprising and has built up a large trade in this section, where 
he is well known and every one is his friend. He owns thirty acres of fine

J. SPICER LEAMING. 

J. Spicer Learning, an attorney and counselor at law. of Cape May City. 
Xew Jersey, was bom in Lower township. Cape May county, November 16. 
1853, and is the son of Jacob and Melvina (Eldredge) Leaming. This family 
represents one of the oldest in the southern section of the state, their repre- 
sentatives having settled here in early colonial days, and their descendants 
have since contributed to the upbuilding and substantial improvement of the 
county. 

Christopher Leaming. the great-grandfather, was bom in Cape May 
county and there resided throughout his life. He married Sarah Spicer. a 
daughter of Jacob Spicer. who also is largely identified with the early history 
of the county, and died about the year 1788. and left surviving him several 
children, one of whom. Spicer Leaming, is the grandfather of our subject. 
The said Spicer Leaming was born in Lower township, where he carried on 
agricultural pursuits, owning considerable land. He was appointed ensign of 
a company of light artillen.- of the Cape May battalion of militia by Major 
Xathaniel Holmes, and his commission, dated June 28, 1794. and signed by 
Richard Howell, Governor, is in the possession of the family. He married 
Hannah Swain, and at his death left sur\-iving him seven children, namely: 
Swain, who married and had two children. — James and Spicer; James, who

married, late in life, a Miss Renolds and made his home in Philadelphia, his 
death occurring in 1876: Israel, who married twice, and left but one daughter. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 289 

Abigail, who became the wife of Dr. W'ilHam Sheppard, whose children are 
noAN^liv'ing at Cape May City; Lemuel, who married and left surviving him 
at his death a daughter, Hannah: she married Wilmon W. Whilldin. who is 
largely engaged in real-estate speculation at West Palm Beach, Florida, and 
is now the mayor of that place; Martha, who was twice married, her first 
husband being David Cresse: they had several children, who are now living 
at Cape May; and Jacob, who was the youngest and the father of our subject. 

Jacob was born on January 16, 1812, in Lower township, Cape May 
county, where he lived the greater portion of his life, and was identified with 
the agricultural pursuits of that locahty, living on a farm just outside the 
limits of the city of Cape May, which has been in the Learning family ever 
since Cape May was first settled. It was one of the oldest properties, if not 
the oldest, in this section of the state, the farm still being owned by his son. 
J. Spicer Leaming, our subject. A few years before his death he retired from 
the farm and spent the remainder of his life in the city of Cape May. He 
was always a Republican in his politics, as had been all of the family before 
him, although never an aspirant for ofifice. He married Aliss Melvina Eld- 
redge and to them were born three children: Teresa E. Townsend. the wife 
of Edward F. Towaisend, an architect and contractor at Cape May City; 
Amanda M. Townsend, the wife of F. Sidney Townsend. who also resides at 
Cape May City; and J. Spicer Learning. The father of these children died 
January 10, 1888, at the age of seventy-six years, and the mother was called 
to her final rest January 13, 1899, also aged seventy-six. 

J. Spicer Leaming spent his lioyhood days at his parental home and ac- 
quired his preliminary education in the common schools, after which he 
continued his studies in Pennington Seminary and in Dickinson College, 
being graduated in the latter institution with the class of 1874. He then 
entered the law office of Hon. F. Carroll Brewster, of Philadelphia, Pennsyl- 
vania, and in 1875 was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar as an attorney, and 
in 1879 was admitted to the supreme court of that state. He practiced law in 
the city of Philadelphia until 1888, having his office at 623 Walnut street, 
with Samuel E. Cavin, who was then assistant city solicitor. Li 1888, on 
account of the declining health of his father, he came to Cape May, where, 
after being admitted to the New Jersey bar, he established an office and has 
since been engaged in general practice. At present he is the corporation 
counsel for the city of Cape ]\Iay. also county solicitor, and solicitor for the 
Lower township and several of the boroughs. 

Mr. Leaming is a Repuljlican in his political affiliations, and for three 
vears served as a member of the board of education. He belongs to the 
Baptist church, is one of its trustees and its financial secretary, and takes an

active and zealous interest in its work. His devotion to the interests of his 
clients is proverbial, and he invariably seeks to present his argument in the 
strong, clear light of reason and sound logical principles. 

On June 20, 1889, Mr. Learning was united in marriage to Miss Helen, a 
daughter of Dr. Jonathan F. Leaming, of Cape May Court House. They lost 
their only child in infancy. 

Mr. Leaming has in his possession an old ring, which is known as Wash- 
ington's ring and which was given by George Washington to Lieutenant 
Richard Somers, of the early United States navy, who presented it to his 
sister, Sarah Keen; she gave it to her niece, Sarah S. Corson, who gave it 
to her son. Dr. Jonathan F. Leaming, father-in-law of our subject. In the 
set which adorns the ring is a lock of Washington's hair, protected by a 
transparent plate. Following is a copy of the affidavit concerning this ring: 

State of New Jersey, ) 
Cape May County, J 

Jonathan F. Leaming, of full age, l:)eing duly sworn according to law, on 
his oath says that he is the son of William Leaming and Sarah Sophia Leam- 
ing, who was the daughter of Constant and Sarah Somers, of the county of 
Gloucester, now Atlantic county; that the said Constant Somers was the 
brother of Sarah Keen, wife of Jonas Keen, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
and of Richard Somers, of the early United States Navy; that the said Rich- 
ard Somers, then a lieutenant in the navy upon his departure to the Metliter- 
ranean under Commodore Preble, in the war with Tripoli, in 1803, deposited 
all his valuables with his said sister Sarah Keen. In this war Lieutenant 
Somers lost his life September 4, 1804. 

Constant Somers being dead, all the personal property of Lieutenant 
Somers passed to his sister, the said Sarah Keen; the said Sarah Keen died 
intestate and without issue, and her estate fell to her niece, the said Sarah 
Sophia Leaming, who had intermarried with Nicholas Corson, of this county 
(Cape May), and deponent administered the estate of the said Sarah Keen, 
deceased. Among the personal effects of the said Sarah Keen was a peculiar, 
antique finger ring, which was always called Washington's ring. It is a flat, 
gold ring, with a square setting of dark-blue enamel. On the outside edge 
of this dark-blue enamel square is a small stripe of white enamel, and in the 
centre of said square is a round box and glass containing hair surmounted by 
thirteen pearls. On each side of said square, on the shanks of the ring, are 
alternate gold and light-blue enamel stripes, within which field of stripes, on 
each side, is a small circle of dark-blue enamel. The hair contained in this 
ring is said to be that of George Washington. 

This deponent avers that he has frequently heard the said Sarah Keen 
declare that this ring was presented to her brother. Lieutenant Richard 
Somers, by George Washington, the first president of the United States, and 
that the hair within the setting was that of Washington, and that her brother

had left the said ring in her care when he eml^arked for Tripoli. The said Wash- 
ington's ring was given to this deponent hv his mother, the said Sarah Sophia 
Corson, and is now deposited with his son-in-law. J. Spicer Leammg. of

JONATHAN F. LEA^IING. 
No history of southern New Jersey would be complete without the record 
of the Learning family, for no other has so long been identified with Cape 
May county or borne so conspicuous and worthy a part in its substantial 
progress and development. About the year 1670 Christopher and Jeremiah 
Learning, brothers, sailed from England to the New World; but the latter 
died on the voyage. Christopher Learning landed in Boston and in 1674

near Cape May Court House, following farming throughout his business 
career. He held several local offices, including that of county sheriff. 
He was a member of a training company of the old days and was a 
member of the Baptist church. He was twice married, his first wife bearing 
the maiden name of Elizabeth Yates. Their children were William, Judith, 
Jonathan, Priscilla and Aaron, but William was the only one who left a fam-

in the schools of Philadelphia and in early life engaged in teaching. He he- 
came a gentleman farmer of Middle township, where he owned an extensive 
tract of land, which he cultivated with the aid of his negro slaves, but before 
his death he set all of his liondsmen free. In politics he was a Whig and served 
as justice of the peace. In his religious faith he was a Baptist. He was twice 
married, his first union being with Catherine Wood, of Philadelphia, by whom 
he had two children: Eliza, who married Nelson Garrison, had a large family

his choice being Sarah Sophia Somers. a daughter of Constance Somers, of 
Atlantic county. Their children were: Catherine, who was born May 19, 
1821, and died in October of the same year; Jonathan Furman; and Julia, the 
wife of Reuben Townsend, a farmer, by whom she had a daughter, — Florence, 
the wife of Rev. Charles W^arwick, of Philadelphia. Mr. Leaming, the 
grandfather, died January 25, 1827. His second wife was born October 11. 
1795, and died July 28, 1866. .\fter the death of her first husband she mar- 
ried Nicholas Corson, and had a daughter, Priscilla, the deceased wife of 
Captain Henry T. Corson, of South Seaville. 

Hon. Jonathan Furman Leaming fully sustains the high reputation which 
the family has always borne, in fact has gained new laurels, and has left the 
impress of his strong individuality upon the public interests of the state. He 
was born in Cape May county, September 7, 1822, and was provided with 
excellent educational advantages. Having attended Colgate Lh:iversity. in 
New York, he later matriculated in Brown L^niversity, where he completed 
his literary course. Subsequently he was graduated in the JefTerson ^ledical 
College of Philadelphia in the class of 1846, and at once entered upon the 
prosecution of his chosen profession. He was married February 22, 1847, 
to Eliza H. Bennett, of Cape May Court House, and located at Seaville, this 
county, and continued the practice of medicine for fourteen years, when his 
health failed him and he was forced to put aside his professional cares. 

Dr. Leaming then pursued a course in the Pennsylvania Dental College in 
Philadelphia, and after his graduation opened an ofifice in Cape Mav Court 
House, where he soon won prestige as a representative of the latter profes- 
sion. His marked skill and ability secured to him a liberal patronage, and 
he continued his active connection with the science of dentistry for many 
years, when in 1898 his health again failed him and he retired permancntlv 
to private life. In 1858 the degree of A. M. was conferred upon him by the 
University at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and in i860 the degree of Doctor of

BlOGUAPtllCAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



Dental Surgery was conferred upon him l)y the Pennsylvania College of Den- 
tal Surgery. 

The Doctor has lieen honored with various positions of trust and respon- 
sibility and over his public career there falls no shadow of wrong. In 1861 
he was elected to the Xew Jersey assembly, and the following year was 
elected to the senate for a three-years term. During that time he was the 
chairman of the committee on education and a member of several other very 
important committees. His course as a legislator fully justified the expecta- 
tion of his friends, placing him among the most useful, enhghtened and 
judicious members of the senate. In 1868 he was elected the surrogate of the 
county for five years, and on the expiration of that term was again elected for 
five years, but resigned on the ist of January. 1877, in order to accept the 
position of senator, to which he was again elected in 1876. Once more tak- 
ing his seat in the upper house, he was made a member of the committee on 
commerce, navigation, miscellaneous business and of other important com- 
mittees. He has ever been a stanch Republican and has labored earnestly 
for the welfare of the party which advocates progress, protection and expan- 
sion. He has always favored the movements and organizations which have 
upheld true Americanism and in early Hfe supported the Whig part}- and the 
American or Know-nothing party. 

On the 22d of February, 1847. Dr. Leaming was united in marriage to 
Miss Eliza Bennett, a daughter of Aaron and Mary (Hildreth) Bennett. To 
them were born four children. Walter S., born November 4, 1854, is now 
engaged in the practice of dentistry. Edmund Bennett, born May 24, 1857, 
studied law, with Judge James Buchanan of Trenton, New Jersey, for a pre- 
ceptor, was admitted to the bar in 1880, practiced for a time in Camden, and 
is now a legal practitioner in San Francisco, California. Helen is the wife of 
J. Spicer Leaming. Herbert, born August 24, 1867, died at the age of 
twelve years. For his second wife Dr. Leaming chose Mrs. Josephine 
.Young, a sister of his first wife, their marriage being celeljrated October 24, 
1888. 

The Doctor is a valued member of various civic societies: belongs to the 
lodge and encampment in the Odd Fellows' fraternity and has filled the local 
ofifices; w'as a member of Cape Island Lodge, F. & A. M., of Cape May, and 
in his life exemplifies the ennol)ling principles of these organizations. He is 
also a member of the Baptist church, with which he has been identified for 
sixty years.

vania, and they have two children, — Harmon Phelps, and Helen F. K. Reed. 



JAMES E. DUNHAM. • 

In reviewing the historv of James Everett Dunham, one is reminded of 
the words of a great New York financier: "If you're not a success don't 
blame the times you live in, don't blame the place you occupy, don't blame 
the circumstances you're surrounded with; lay the blame where is belongs — 
to yourself. Not in time, place or circumstance, but in the man lies success. 
If you want success you must pay the price." Realizing the truth of this. 
Mr. Dunham has paid the price of concentrated efifort, of indefatigable en- 
ergy-, or perseverance and well applied business principles, and has won the 
victory which he started out to win years ago. 

The Dunham family is one of the honored ones of Salem county. Joseph 
Dunham, the father of James E.. was a lifelong resident of Lower Penn's 




t^^/nv^ ^' [/^^y^^^^^f^^^ 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 297 

Neck township. He was an exceptionally fine mechanic and made a good 
U.S?hood for himself and family. For a wife he cl-eNaom. Madden, and 
to them eight children were born, namely: Jeremiah; David Joseph Sarah, 
vife ofWihiam Zane; James E.: Mary Ellen, who married Thomas Counsel- 
o tna. wife of Isaac Horner, a farmer near Greenwich and Lizzie who 
diek h. childhood. All of these children have passed to the siknt land with 
t exception of our subject, and their parents departed this life many years 



ago. 



Tames E. Dunham was born in Lower Penn's Neck township February 
4 1833 His education was obtained in the schools of that locality and in 
Salem during the winter terms, the rest of the year being devoted to farm 
worT His father dving when the lad was about ten years of age, he started 
orth to e rn his own living, and from that time forward was dependent upon 
his native resources. Until he was sixteen years of age, he was employed on 
t "e farm of Mark Stretch, and then entered upon a regular f^ve-years appren- 
ticeship to Richard C. Ballinger, a bricklayer and contractor. H-mg tlor- 
oughlv mastered the trade, he embarked m business, and smce i860 las 
commanded a large share of the building and contracting o Salem 
and vicinity. Manv of the finest business blocks, public structures and pnva e 
sidences'of the place stand as monuments to his skill -d, w^. no a X 
few exceptions, all of the brick and better class of buildings of Salem .eie 
erected under his supervision. For about forty years he has had the repu ta^ 
tion of being the most extensive contractor in his line in the -un^". and 
often has given employment to as many as thirty-five men. Among 1 e 
substantialbuildings which he has constructed a few may be -^n .oned^ th 
Salem National Bank, the Salem Opera House, Dr. Pat erson ^ ^lo^^' ^i an 
and Walnut street school-houses, the Baptist Memorial church and se^eral 
fine residences. Besides, many of the brick buildings and attractive residences 
of Millville and other towns were erected by Mr. Dunham, whose reputation 
as a contractor and builder is widespread and greatly to be envied. His 
own beautiful brick and brown-stone residence, built by him in 1891, is a 
fine example of modern architecture and style, and is conceded to be one of 
the finest homes in Salem and Salem county. 

He has also been interested in various local enterprises, and m opening 
Wesley street he made a new and convenient means of communication with 
the business center, for the residents of that portion of the town. At one 
time he was financially concerned in an ice business, giving employment to 
about seventy-five men every season for a number of years. Prosperity at- 
tended his industrious and well directed efforts, and he is now in the pos- 
session of a comfortable competency. He owns some fine town property, and 



298 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

one of the finest, best improved farms in the county, comprising one hundred 
and fourteen acres and situated in ]\Iannington township. 

In his political preferences Air. Dunham favors the Republican party. 
Fraternally he is connected with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, 
and is a charter member of Fenwick Lodge, Xo. 164. In the Methodist 
Episcopal church he has long been looked upon as one of the leading mem- 
bers and has served as trustee, steward and in various other of^cial positions 
in the congregation. 

The marriage of Mr. Dunham and Melissa Husted was solemnized No- 
vember II, 1855. She was a daughter of John C. and Emeline (Smith) Hus- 
ted, the former of whom died in Salem, after which the mother became the 
wife of Charles Baker, and had two children by that union, namely: Charles 
and David. Mrs. Dunham was the second of the ten children born to lier 
parents, the others being \\'illiam, Alonzo, Emeline, Smith, Clement, Dayton 
and three who died in early childhood. The marriage of our subject and 
wife was blessed with ten children. The eldest born, Eloise Amanda Villis, 
married Charles Brandifif, a bricklayer by trade and a resident of Salem, and 
their three children are \\'ilbur, Anna and David. Emma is the second child 
in order of birth, ^^'ilbur. the third, married Sallie Harris and they have had 
three children. — James, Grace and Bessie, of whom the two eldest have died. 
Fannie is the fourth child of our subject. Lydia, the next, is the wife of 
Richard Ernest, a blacksmith and carriage manufacturer, of Clayville, this 
county, and their children are George. Frank, Robert, Richard. Merrill. Win- 
field and Naona. Fenwick Archer Dunham married Sallie Headly and their 
children are named Melissa. Fenwick A. and Katie Margaret. Albert Sher- 
ron married Agnolia Payne and has three children, — ^James E.. Hari-iet and 
Albert. Harr\' Sickler Dunham was married January 24, 1896, to Eva. a 
daughter of James H. Darlington, of Alloway. Salem county. Frank, who 
lives in Atlantic City, is, like his elder brothers, a bricklayer by trade. Lizzie 
v., the youngest of this large and promising family, is the wife of David M. 
Ayres, a machinist of Salem, and their little sons are named Robert D. and 
Harry. Our subject and wife have reason to be proud of their children, all 
of whom are industrious, patriotic citizens, a credit to the several communi- 
ties in which thev dwell.

S' of the arrival of his countrymen, went to interview the party, and tried to 
i duce them to locate upon land owned by the company he represented. 
H^offe were generous in the extreme, and the result was that he was taken 
nt his word H^ agreed to sell the property at three dollars an acre, payable 
1 wheat at six shiUings a bushel, and, moreover, provided necessary pro^^s- 
icn nd farming implements while a crop was being raised, t^- assisting his 
friends in everv practical manner possible. Peter Campbell selected a 
av V timbered tract of land, one hundred and seventy-five acres m ex ten 
n 1 siuiated just north of the springs mentioned. The rude og cabin whi h 
h b lilt at fi St was soon supplanted by a substantial frame dwelling, which. 
Inth some alterations and improvements, stands on the homestead to-day. in 
a fine state of preservation. 

Tr'le to the old Covenanter spirit, one of the first matters which engaged 
the attention of these early settlers at Caledonia, as the place was called^was 
that of holding religious services. A meeting was held at the house of Peter 
Campbell. November 10. 1802. for the purpose of organizing a congregation. 
aiKl several important steps toward this end were taken. Five trustees were 
elected. Mr. Campbell being one of the number, and a name -as dead d

sin, and John P. was interred at Nelson, Xeliraska. Tlie other children were 
named respectively: Duncan, Daniel, Peter P., Alexander and Ann. 

On the 19th of August, 1898, the one hundredth anniversary of the com- 
ing of Peter Campbell and family to America was celebrated in a pleasant and 
fitting manner by a number of his direct descendants who assembled at the 
old Caledonia homestead. Among those present were some of the grand- 
children and great-grandchildren of the pioneer Peter Campbell, and of those 
who came from a distance were Dr. Duncan Campbell, of Woodbury, Miss 
Christabel Campbell, of Denver, Colorado, Miss Florence Campbell, of 
Brooklyn, New York, and Rev. John P. Campbell, of Baltimore, Maryland. 
A short and very enjoyable program was carried out, it being as follows: 
Singing of America; prayer by Rev. J. A. Sherrard; remarks by Rev. J. P. 
Campbell; reminiscences of Peter Campbell by Mrs. Charles Clark, Mrs. F. 
C. W'ells, and Mr. James DeNoon; remarks by A. F. McPherson and singing 
of "Home, Sw-eet Home." Many of the facts gleaned from those who had 
known Peter Campbell were gratefully received by those present and will be 
treasured by them. Mrs. Clark told the company that the first Sunday-school 
at Caledonia was organized by Mr. Campbell and Dr. Peter McPherson, and 
that she was one of the pupils in this school, as were Mrs. W^ells and Mrs. 
Lydia Cameron. They met in a school-house which stood for many years 
upon a lot now owned by John Connor, on North street, just south of the 
railroad tracks. Mr. DeNoon related numerous interesting things in regard 
to the character, habits and personal appearance of Mr. Campbell, the 
pioneer, and Rev. J. P. Cam.pbell spoke feelingly of the old home belonging 
to that worthy man, his grandfather — the house which w'as the birthplace of 
his (the minister's) father and himself. He spoke of the elevating atmos- 
phere of this pioneer home, of the good influences which emanated from its 
sacred walls, and of the days when the neighbors were wont t6 assemble there 
on the Sabbath, to worship God. The hardships which were bravely and 
cheerfully endured by the early settlers of Caledonia were mentioned at some 
length, as well as the success, the comfortable homes and fortunes which they 
made for themselves and children, in time, and the indelible impress of their 
noble Christian lives upon their own and succeeding generations. Amidst 
all of the changes which the century has brought, it was pointed out that the 
boundaries of the old homestead are almost identical to-day with those of 
1799, when the land was laid out. 

Peter P. Campbell, the father of the subject of this sketch, was born and 
reared upon this historical old farm, and from youth until old age he followed 
agriculture as a means of livelihood. He remained upon the old homestead, 
making numerous valuable improvements thereon and buying additional

property from time to time. He was a public-spirited citizen, a faithful mem- 
ber of the Presbyterian church and for a quarter of a century a rulmg elder, 
his influence always being used in the furtherance of uprightness and prog- 
ress He was twice married, by his f^rst union having five children, namely: 
Catherine- Peter P., who wedded Elizabeth McPherson; Jane, the wife of 
Robert Ritchie; Daniel P.. deceased: and James P. The second wife of Peter 
P Campbell. Sr.. Margaret McKenzie, was likewise of Scotch extraction, 
and their children were: Margaret A.: Rev. John P.. now a resident of Bal- 
timore, Maryland; Elizabeth: Jennette; Alexander P.; Ellen Mary the wife of 
Hugh Campbell; Christabel. of Denver. Colorado: Florence A., of Brooklyn. 
New York; Eva J., and Duncan. 

The last named, the youngest of the family, was born m Caledonia Xew 
York and there mastered the rudiments of knowledge in the public schools 
Then'he engaged in teaching school for a few terms, after which he entered 
the Geneseo Normal school of Geneseo. New York, and for two years studi- 
ously applied his attention to the higher branches of science and literature. 
Next we find him in a school in Baltimore, where scholars are specially pre- 
pared for future work in the Johns Hopkins University, but at the close of a 
year in that institution he was enrolled at Princeton College, where he was 
duly graduated in 1892. , • rt 

It was in the autumn of that year that the Doctor entered upon his life 
wn-k l>v becoming a student m Hahnemann Medical College, at Philadel- 
phia, and after taking a thorough course of instruction he was honored by 
having the degree of Doctor of Medicine bestowed upon him, in 1895 with 
-he additional reward, for his conscientious and meritorious course, of being 
chosen to act as the resident physician of Hahnemann Hospital. He re- 
mained there for one vear. with such success attending his labors as a physi- 
cian that he was then elected to the chair of medical terminology m the col- 
lege, a position he still retains. 

On the 7th of May. 1896, Dr. Campbell came to Woodbury, where he 
took charge of the practice of the late Dr. C. G. Abbott till his death. Since 
that time^Dr. Campbell has conducted the practice alone, his success and 
popularity being of the most pronounced kind. He is a great student, de- 
voting much of his limited leisure to study of medical science and kindred 
subjects. He is a member of the W^est Jersey Medical Society, the Truso 
Medical Club, the Alumni Association of Hahnemann College and the Ger- 
mantown Medical Society. He is unmarried and is deservedly popular m the 
local society of Woodbury and every place in which he has dwelt. In his 
politics the Doctor is a Republican. 



302 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

WILLIAM A. SUMMERILL. 

William A. Summerill, who was born April 19, 1862, is one of the repre- 
sentative young business men of the borough of Penn's Grove, and on ac- 
count of his position as editor and manager of a local newspaper, The Rec- 
ord, wields a wide influence in this community. He is intensely patriotic, 
doing all within his power to promote the welfare of his locality, and by the 
wisdom and sound good sense which he exercises at all times he has won the 
good will and genuine regard of those who know him. 

One of the oldest and most honored families of Salem county is the one 
to which Mr. Summerill belongs, and those who have borne the name are 
often mentioned in the histories of the religious and political parties of the 
county. The ancestry can be traced for about one hundred and seventy-five 
years. The grandfather of our subject, Judge William Summerill, was a 
man of means and influence when in the nrime of life, and took a leading 
part in the building of the Delaware River Railroad, which proved of such 
great benefit to this section of the state. From 1868 to 1878 he was a lay 
judge of the county courts. He was born in 1812, and departed this life in 
1886, mourned by a large circle of lifelong friends. His wife, Hannah A. 
Summerill, lived to be eighty-three years of age. She was likewise a repre- 
sentative of an old colonial family of this county, — the Yannemans. Her 
father was Daniel Vanneman, a leading farmer and business man of Penn's 
Neck. To the union of William and Hannah Summerill two sons were born. 
Josiah and Daniel V., the latter now a successful farmer and the chosen free- 
holder of Upper Penn's Neck township. 

The father of our subject is Josiah Summerill, of Upper Penn's Neck 
township, Salem county, — a well known citizen who at present is serving as 
collector of taxes for his township, which position he has held continuously 
for twenty-five years. He is also a director of the Salem National Banking 
Company. His wife, whose maiden name was Sally Austin, is the only 
daughter of William Austin by his first wife, Mary Ann Watson. Her parents 
were residents of Piles Grove township, where their only son, Samuel, is now 
making him home. 

William A. Summerill was reared in the usual occupation of farmer lads, 
and after completing a district-school education he entered Pennington's 
Seminary, where he was graduated at the age of eighteen years. Returning 
then to the home farm, he remained there until twenty-two years of age. 
devoting his attention to general agricultural duties. In September, 1884. 
he and his cousin, Daniel V. Summerill, Jr., formed a business connection, 
and together conducted the Penn Grove Record and carried on general 





,:^^i7^t^C-^^o^i^^^T^-'t^-'^'iy^i'''-^ 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 303 

printing until October, 1887, when the junior partner retired from the firm. 
William A. Summerill has since continued the business alone, and has made 
the Record a wide-awake, interesting local journal. It has been changed 
from a six to an eight-column sheet and various other improvements have 
been instituted, thus placing the Record on a par with the leading journals 
of the county. In 1892 the enterprising publisher built a new and modern 
printing of^ce and equipped it with up-to-date machinery. 

The Record was established in November, 1878, by the Rev. J. W. 
Laughlin, of the New Jersey Methodist Protestant Conference, who sold it 
in February, 1883, to Joseph D. Whitaker. Mr. Whitaker sold it to the firm 
of Summerill & Summerill fifteen years ago. 

The subject of this review is also a land surveyor, the only one of the 
borough. For the past ten years he has been appointed by the legislature 
to be a commissioner of deeds, and in connection with the duties of that 
of^ce does considerable conveyancing of properties. 

The marriage of William A. Summerill and Miss Kate H. Weigher, 
daughter of William Webber, of Course Landing, Salem county, was solem- 
nized in 1891. Four children, two sons and two daughters, were born of the 
union, namely: William W., Mary, Frederick and Verna. He lives in a 
pleasant home on South Broad street, and delights more in a quiet, happy 
home life with his family than in society. Having a refined literary taste, he 
has accumulated a choice private library and is most pleased when sur- 
rounded by his books and papers. Yet he has a pleasing address and is 
social with all he meets. Mr. Summerill is a member of Emanuel Methodist 
Episcopal church, is a trustee and a steward, and for several years has taken 
an active part in Sunday-school work as superintendent and teacher. The 
Summerill family has been identified with this church since its organization in 
1845 — the first ch.urch in Penn's Grove — and have held positions in the 
denomination since its establishment in Upper Penn's Neck township in the 
early part of the century. William A. Summerill represents the fourth con- 
secutive generation that has held ofiice in the church.

kindred names of \\hitacre. \Miitacar, A\'hitaker, W'hittaker. etc.. are be- 
lieved to have been the same originally, and written W'hitacre (meaning white 
acre). The name is found in English history as early as the fourteenth cen- 
tur\'. and it once identified a locality in England. Of the several coats of 
arms distinguishing the family in its different branches, one bears the inter- 
esting motto. "Robur atque Fides." Other names, such as Whither, \\'hite- 
field. Whittier, etc., are supposed to have sprung from the same root. 

Among the eminent W'hitakers of England are the Rev. \^'illiam W'hit- 
aker, the Master of St. John's College at Cambridge, an anti-papal writer, 
who died in 1595; and the Rev. Jeremiah Whitaker, who. in 1643, was elected 
a member of the assembly of \\'estminster, and in 1647 filled the oflfice of 
moderator. He died in London June ist, 1654. He had a son, Robert, who 
was a Puritan disputant, preacher and writer. Also Rev. John \Miitaker, 
who published man}- volumes of local and British history and died in 1808; 
and the Rev. Edward W. Whitaker, celebrated for his part in establishing 
"The Refuge for the Destitute" in London. He died in 1818. "The 
Genealogist" and "The Genealogist's Guide," English publications, give 
several Whitaker pedigrees. The name is still numerously and honorably 
in evidence in England. 

The first \Miitaker in this countrj^ is believed to have been the Rev. 
Alexander Whitaker, called "the apostle," a son of the Rev. William ^^'hita- 
ker above mentioned. He was born in 1585. at Cambridge, England, came 
to Virginia in 161 1 and was put in charge of the Episcopal church at Hen- 
rico. This was the second parish established in Virginia. On the glebe of 
one hundred acres belonging to the church, he built a parsonage called 
"Rock Hall." Pocahontas was baptized in the Henrico church and married 
to John Rolf by Mr. \Miitaker. Her baptism is the subject of a painting in 
the rotunda of the capitol at Washington, D. C. 

George Whittacre was a passenger on "The William of London," bound 
from Virginia to London, 13 May, 1654. Others, whose names were of a 
different spelling, were in Virginia as earh- as 1656 and 1662, and elsewhere 
in the seventeenth century, taking up land. On this side of the Atlantic, at 
the present time, there are several Whitaker families, apparently not related. 
But. when a name can be proven to be five or six centuries old, it is not dififi- 
cult to understand how traces of the broken-of? branches, even from one par- 
ent in the long ago. can be lost in new homes, in new places, with the same 
spirit of adventure. It is true of large families, in less than one hundred 
years, where the members are widel}- separated. 

We have in this country the old Connecticut family, the "iron" Whitakers 
of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to whom the distinguished Judge Samuel 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 305 

Whitaker Pennypacker. of Philadelphia, belongs, those of Alaryland. New- 
York, and other states, now in the fourth, f^fth. sixth and seventh generations 
on this side of the sea. A conspicuous man was the Rev. Nathaniel Whita- 
ker, D. D., son of Jonathan Whitaker. who first settled in New England, but 
afterward removed to New Jersey. Dr. Whitaker went with the Mohecan 
Indian, the Rev. Sampson Occum, of Long Island, to England and Scot- 
■ land, in 1767. They collected fifty thousand dollars— a grand sum for that 
time— wherewith Dartmouth College was founded, partly for the education 
of Indians. He was a Presbyterian, a flaming patriot during the Revolution 
and a voluminous writer. A member of this branch, Ephraim Seward 
Whitaker, of Ohio, has spent years and quite a large sum of money in collect- 
ing genealogies of the name, in its many forms, all over this country and 
England, with the hope that he. or some one. can in the future complete the 
laudable undertaking and publish the same. 

References to the Whitakers and their genealogies are found in a number 
of American books. The ramifications are. seemingly, endless. Only a 
limited investigation indicates connections with some of the oldest and most 
important families in the United States. As a race, noted as patriots, serving 
wherever found, in all the periods of conflict here. 

The ancestor of most, if not all. the Whitakers whose homes have long 
been in the southern part of New Jersey as also of very many in other parts 
of the United States, is Richard Whitaker. of the city of London. England. 
There is a tradition that he first came to this country at the time of the plague, 
in 1665, or in i()Ob, after the great fire, and then returned to England. A 
Richard Whittaker bought 135 acres of land in James Cittie county. Virginia. 
in 1666. one hundred and fifty-eight acres in Middlesex county, of the same 
state, in 1667, and a Richard Whitaker was in Warwick county. Virginia, in 
the seventeenth centurv, whose descendants are now numerous around En- 
field, North Carolina. But no one has yet been able to prove that these 
Richards represent one man and is identical with the Richard who landed in 
Salem in 1675. 

For among those who came with John Fenwick. to \\'est New Jersey, was 
Richard Whitaker. .\fter a custom of that age. the ship was named from ' 
an animal and was called the "Griftin." It is said to have anchored opposite 
Elsinborough Point. September 23. 1675. Richard Whitaker brought with 
him a power of attorney from William Hancock, executed July 6. 1675. and. 
according to the family report, that was the day previous to the departure of 
the ship. In this paper the name is spelled Whittaker. The power of attor- 
nev and the black morocco book (now visibly eaten by the tooth of time) are 
still in the possession of the family and highly prized. 



3o6 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Richard \\ hitaker was made one of Fenwick's Council of Proprietors to 
govern West New Jersey, holding the office from 1676 to 1702, when the 
colonial government was formed. Salem was his residence until about 1690. 
January 17, 1679, at Salem, in the old log meeting-house of the Friends on 
the Nicholson lot (now the cemetery), he married Elizabeth Adkin, daughter 
of George Provoe, of Monmouth precinct. The will of George Provoe, 
dated 1688, mentions Elizabeth, the wife of Richard, and Elizabeth, daugh- 
ter of Richard Whitaker. 

In 1690 Richard Whitaker and his wife moved to the South Cohansic pre- 
cinct and settled on the one thousand acres of land which had been set ofif to 
him, near New England Town, now Fairton. He built a substantial brick 
dwelling which descended from father to son for more than one hundred 
years, and part of the land remained in the family for a still longer period. 
The house was taken down about 1866. He and Henry Buck kept a store 
in the vicinity for general merchandise, supposed to have been the only one 
east of the Cohansey river. The site of the present thriving city of Bridgeton 
was then a wilderness. They owned a large sloop, trading with New York 
and Boston. One of Richard Whitaker's descendants has the store-book. 
It gives the names of many of the early inhabitants of what is now Cumber- 
land county. The first entry is dated October 9, 1704. and on the page be- 
fore is written: ''We sailed from Boston September iSth. 1704." Both 
men w'ere prominent in Fairfield and transacted a large amount of public 
business. Richard Whitaker's name frequently appears in the court minutes 
to be seen in the Salem clerk's office, beginning with 1706. After 1709 his 
name is missing. It has been thought that he died during the ne.xt year, 
aged about sixty-six years, but the date is uncertain. The early records are 
supposed to have passed into the hands of some branch of the family who 
may have removed from the state and with whom communication was lost, 
as there were several children. Two sons were named Richard and Nathan- 
iel: a daughter married an Alexander (one of a large family of that name in 
F'airfield in 1704); and a granddaughter, Margaret Whitaker. married John 
Jessup, in 1734. Richard w-as a favorite name, according to the records in 
■Trenton. The wills probated and the letters of administration granted have 
not satisfactorily explained the beginnings of the family here. It is known 
that Richard, Sr., signed his name Whittaker, Whitaker, and Whitacar. It 
is probable that in his day every Englishman who w-rote his own name spelled 
it in half a dozen diiTerent ways. The late Alfred Vail, of New Jersey, found 
his family name in various records and documents, on this side of the ocean, 
written with more than twenty variations. "Whitaker" is now the generally 
accepted form. 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF A'£ff JERSEY. 307 

He and his wife. Elizalietli. were meml^ers of the Society of Friends, but 
the family became interested in the Presbyterian church at New Fairfield, 
which was organized about the time of his removal to the place. In an entry 
uf the old store-book, under the date of December 22. 1704. he is charged 
with a catechism. In 1755 the dwelling of the minister. Rev. Daniel Elmer. 
was burned and. as the records of the Presl)yterian church were m it, they 
perished also. Thus are irretrievably lost many items of family as well as of 

church history. 

Nathaniel Whitaker (or -car), a son of Richard. .Sr.. was married to ^lary 
Dixon. November 18. 1729. Their children were Ambrose. Lemuel and 
Lewis. A grandson of the latter. John Whitaker. was one of the framers of 
the constittition of Illinois in 1818. Nathaniel Whitaker's second wife was 
Ruth Buck; the marriage September 13. 1738- Their children were Sarah, 
Hannah. Daniel and Ruth. Hannah married Ephraim Foster and was the 
mother of ten children, one of whom, Esther, married the Rev. Ethan 
Osborne, of Fairfield, being his second wife; one child, Robert, also a Presby- 
terian minister. The Rev. Isaac Foster, pastor of the Pittsgrove Presby- 
terian church, from 1791 to 1794. belonged to this family. 

Ambrose, the son of Nathaniel and iMary (Dixon) Whitaker (or -car), was 
born December 15, 1730. He married Freelove Stratton January ib. 1755. 
Their children were Freelove. Mary. Nathaniel, Abigail and Catharine. 
Freelove married Butler Thompson, and one of her grandsons, named 
Thomas Sylvers, became noted as an inventor. Mary married Jedediah 
Ogden, an elder in the Fairfield church. The eldest of her five children. 
Isaac Ambrose, became a Presbyterian minister, laboring in Ohio and on the 
verge of Indiana for many years. Nathaniel, the third child of Ambrose and 
Mary (Dixon) Whitaker, married his cousin Lydia Whitaker (a daughter of 
Lewis). Two of their grandsons (children of Joel) were missionaries.— Dan- 
iel 'A'hitaker, in Burmah. and Ethan Osborne \\hitaker fell at the front 
preaching the gospel at Yankton. Dakota. Another grandson, one of the 
ten chikfren of Reuel and Sarah (Westcott) \\'hitaker. is the Rev. Epher 
Whitaker. D. D., of Southold. Long Island. He was the pastor of the Pres- 
byterian church there for over forty years, his only charge. He has been a 
w'riter of much repute, both in prose and verse, and has been noted for his 
historical researches. His address, in 1880. at the bi-centennial celebration 
of the old stone church of Fairfield, now called Fairton. which has been pub- 
lished and extensively circulated, will keep his memory green in the home of 
his youth and in the ever-widening circles from it. His eightieth birthday 
was' appropriately commemorated March 2j. 1900. His son, the Rev. Wil- 
liam F. Whitaker, D. D.. was the first pastor of the St. Cloud Presbyterian 



3o8 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

cliurcli at South Orange, New Jersey, and lie is now the ]iastor of the First 
Presbyterian church of Albany, New- York. 

The second wife of Ambrose Whitaker was Ruth Harris. They were 
married December lo, 1766. Their children were David, Hannah and 
Lewis. Hannah married the Rev. Buckley Carll. one of the pastors of the 
Pittsgrove Presbyterian church, afterward of Rahway, New Jersey. He is 
buried in the old Pittsgrove cemetery. He was one of the original members 
of the West Jersey Presbytery. Ambrose Whitaker married his third wife, — 
Rachel Leake, a daughter of Recompense Leake, ist, October 5. 1772. 
Their children were Recompense, Oliver, Freelove, Isaac and Sarah Leake. 
Ambrose Whitaker (or -car) died November 5, 1796. Rachel Leake Whita- 
ker (or -car) died January 30, 1823, in her eightieth year. Both are buried 
in the same grave in the old Presbyterian cemetery at Daretown (Pittsgrove). 

Isaac, the fourth child of Ambrose and Rachel Leake Whitaker, was born 
January 11, 1780. After a preparatory education in Pittsgrove, he was sent 
to the Classical Academy at Woodbury, New Jersey, boarding at a private 
house. This institution dated from 1791 and the Rev. Andrew Hunter, Jr., 
was the first teacher. It maintained a high rank as a place of learning for a 
number of years, and perhaps few schools of that period could point to so 
many who became distinguished in their maturer years. Among the well- 
known men enrolled as its pupils in their youth were Dr. James Rush, Com- 
modore Benjamin Cooper, Commodore Stephen Decatur and Captain James 
Lawrence of the "Chesapeake," whose dying entreaty, "Don't give up the 
ship," has passed into a proverb. The latter was the especial friend of Isaac 
Whitaker. To him, James Lawrence told his dreams and his expectation 
of getting a midshipman's commission. His mind was ever on the life in the 
great waters and his leisure was devoted to drawing ships. He colored a 
picture of the ship named the "Light Horse of Philadelphia" and presented 
it to Isaac Whitaker as a token of his regard, and it is in the possession of 
one of his daughters, Mrs. Caroline W. Van Meter, of Salem, New Jersey. 

March 10, 1814, Isaac Whitaker was married to Ann Fithian, a daughter 
of Jonathan Fithian, 3d, and Mary Harris. Jonathan Fithian, ist. was one 
of the earliest settlers about Fairfield, New Jersey, at the beginning of the 
eighteenth century, coming from Long Island. The Fithians have been dis- 
tinguished for their intelligence .and for the beauty of some of the women of 
the family. The earlier years of their married life were spent by Isaac and 
Ann (Fithian) Whitaker, in Deerfield, New Jersey, chiefly upon the estate 
inherited by Mrs. Whitaker from her father, who was one of the largest land 
owners in Cumberland county. Besides looking after the farm of over five 
hundred acres, Isaac Whitaker was a civil magistrate for a great many years. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 309 

one of the judges of the court of common pleas of Cumberland county and a 
major of the militia. He was an ardent Whig in politics and an official m a 
Alasonic organization. Reading was one of his greatest pleasures and his 
well informed mind, gift of humor, genial and courteous manner, made him 
interesting, socially. His facial resemblance to the Rev. Archibald Alexan- 
der D D., was so striking as to suggest a possible consanguinity. Twelve 
children came to their home: Isaac, Ann. Mary. Sarah. Caroline. Oliver, 
Enoch, Charles, Eliza. James. Lydia and Lewis. Eliza died in her infancy, 
Charles in his youth. The others came to maturity, married and had fami- 
lies. Five made their homes in the west, where the majority of the descend- 
ants of Isaac Whitaker and his wife can now be found. Only two of then- 
daughters are living at the present time (1900): Caroline, who married 
Edward Van Meter, of Salem (see \'an dieter Ancestral Notes); and Lydia, 
who married Jonathan D. Ayres. of Bridgeton, a nephew of Governor Seeley. 
Of the four children of the latter, two survive. Caroline \'. CMrs. Elmer :Mu1- 
ford) and Florence. 

In their later years. Isaac Whitaker and his wife moved to Bridgeton. 
where they both departed this life, the latter, May 23. 1855. in her sixty-third 
year; the former. February 23. 1857, in his seventy-eighth year. Both are 
iniried in the Presbyterian cemetery at Deertield. New Jersey. 



JOHN H. B. COOPER. 



John H. B. Cooper, who is one of the successful agriculturists of Salem 
county, New Jersey, and a resident of Elmer, was born in Kent county. Dela- 
ware, December 17, 1853. This Cooper family dates the settlement of its 
first American ancestors in Delaware away back to an early time, when the 
Coopers came from England. Our subject's father was born at about the 
same place he was, as was also his father, whose name was Ezekiel. our sub- 
ject's father's name being Robert B. Cooper. Ezekiel. an uncle of our sub- 
ject's father, was among the earliest Methodist preachers in America. Rob- 
ert B. was by trade a tanner and currier. — a trade not so well known now as 
it was fifty years ago. He now resides with our subject, aged seventy-six 
years. He followed his trade many years, and also farming to a considerable 
extent. He settled in this county in 1874. He. too. belonged to the Meth- 
odist church, and was for many years a class-leader and local preacher. His 
wife's maiden name was Mary Hawkins, and she was a daughter of John 
Hawkins, who was among the first to effect a settlement in Delaware. She 
passed from the scenes of this life in 1881. 



3IO BiOGR.iFHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Our subject, the only one of their three children now living, attended the 
common schools to some extent and then began farming. In 1889 he pur- 
chased the seventy-five-acre farm on which he now lives. He operates also a 
profitable dairy, with a fine herd of Jerseys. Politically, he is a believer in 
the chief principles of the Democratic party. He was the collector for his 
township in 1894-5-6. He belongs to the order of Red Men and in religious 
matters our subject clings to the Methodist faith. 

September 9, 1875, Mr. Cooper was married to Mary Miller, the daughter 
of Joseph ]\Iiller, of Elmer. By this marriage the home circle was blessed 
with six children: Mrs. Ralph Hitchner. residing near Elmer: Mary. Ger- 
trude. Robert. Chrissie and Joseph, at home. In mingling" with the good 
people of this county, one will seldom find one more agreeable and truer to 
his county, to his town antl to his famiU'. than ^Ir. Cooper. It is such men 
as this, together with their interesting families, that make life worth the liv- 
ing and the nation worth preserving, at any cost. 



SWAIX SHAW REE\'ES. 

A special place of honor should be accorded the patriot who fought and 
endured untold hardships for his country, as did the subject of this review. 
He has been a lifelong resident of Cape May county, his birth having oc- 
curred in Lower township. July 17, 1836. His parents were Joshua H. and 
Ellen (W'oolson) Reeves. His father having died when our subject v;as a 
small boy, the latter went to live in the home of the Rev. Moses William- 
son, of Cold Spring, and subsequently resided with Dr. Virgil Marccy. He 
was aft'orded common educational advantages, and early mastered the various 
details of agriculture, to which occupation he has given his princij^al atten- 
tion. 

By industr}- and enterprise ]\Ir. Reeves had accunndated a competence, 
and had made a fair start in life, being the owner of a good farm when the 
clouds of the civil war began to gather darkly. \Mien he had become con- 
vinced that his country was. indeed, in danger, be left his young wife and 
pleasant home and hastened to oft'er his services to the Union. Enlisting as 
a private in Company A. Seventh Regiment of Xew Jersey Volunteers, on 
the 23d of August. 1861. he was mustered in. with forty of his friends and 
neighbors from Lower township, at Trenton, and was assigned for duty 
in the Army of the Potomac. On the ist of December, 1862, he was pro- 
moted to the rank of corporal. He participated in several of the most im- 
portant campaigns and battles of the war, among them being the siege of 





f

CO.YGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEW JERSEY. 311 

Yorktown: Williamsburg-; Richmond, the seven days' battle of the Wilder- 
ness; Malvern Hill, Bristow Station, Gainesville, Manassas. Chantilly, Fred- 
ericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg. Kelly's Ford and ]Mine Run. At 
Petersburg, \"irginia. he was wounded in the heel Ijy a fragment of shell, and 
was in the hospital from June until August, then returning to his regiment. 
At the battle of Petersburg he was wounded in the left hip by a minie ball, 
which passed through his canteen and haversack, and in the first day's fight 
at Gettysburg was wounded by a piece of shell. He was faithful to every trust 
reposed in him and won the commendation of his superior officers for his 
reliability, cheerful discharge of duty and bravery under all circumstances. 

After he had been honorably discharged from the Union army Mr. 
Reeves returned home and resumed his former occupations. The small farm 
which he had purchased in the vicinity of Cape May Point before he went into 
the armv is the same one on which he has resided ever since. It is especially 
suited for market gardening, and he reaps a comfortable income from this 
source each year. 

The old comrades of the civil war are especially dear to Mr. Reeves, and 
he takes great interest in the Grand Army of the Republic. He has occu- 
pied all of the offices save that of commander in M. E. Croy Post, No. 40, 
of Cape May City. Politically he is an ardent Republican, and held the 
office of coroner for one term. Since 1865 he has been an elder and deacon 
in the Presbvterian church, and from his youth has been an active worker in 
this denomination. 

The marriage of Mr. Reeves and Miss Sylvenia Church was celebrated 
November 27, 1859. Of their six children three died in infancy, namely: 
Charles Wesley, Joseph Hooker and Edward Hewitt. George, who married 
Sarah Strong, is engaged in business as a gold beater, at Cape May; and El- 
mer, the youngest surviving son, is occupied in the same calling. Edward 
P.. the second son, is the foreman of the Star Printing office at Cape May 
Citv. He is married and has one child, named Nelson. 



J. HAMPTON LEONARD. 

For more than two hundred and fifty years the Leonard family, of which 
our subject is a representative, has been found in America. The original 
ancestors were of English birth and three brothers of the name came from 
England to the New World in the Mayflower. The house then built by 
them was still standing a few }ears ago. At an early da)' representatives of 
the name came to New Tersev and Isaac Leonard, the great-grandfather, was 



3i- 



BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



Ijorii near Trenton in this state. He afterward removed to Washington, 
Pennsylvania, prior to the war of the Revokition, and there Abner Leonard, 
the grandfather, was born. Aaron L. Leonard, the father, was also a native 
of Washington, Pennsylvania, and in that state acquired his education, being 
graduated at Washington College in 1836, and at the Allegheny Seminary in 
Pittsburg in 1839. He won the highest honors of the class and was the vale- 
dictorian. Ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian church, he went to 
Iowa and was the first installed preacher of that denomination in the Hawk- 
eye state. For five years he remained in Kossuth and continued his resi- 
dence in Iowa, where he labored as a missionary until 1866. In that year he 
came to New Jersey and was actively identified with the work of the ministry 
here until 1896. He was born in 1812, and although eighty-seven years of 
age his mental faculties are still undimmed. He was a man of strong intel- 
lectuality and was a firm and eloquent speaker, whose logic convinced the 
minds of many of his hearers. He was particularly successful in revivalist 
work and his services were in much demand in that line of religious teaching. 
The cause of abolition also found in him a most earnest and stanch advocate 
and his influence in its behalf was most effective. He is an excellent Greek 
and Latin scholar and at one time was employed as a teacher of Hebrew and 
Greek in an institute in Quincy, Illinois. He married Caroline R. Chamber- 
lain, and for fifty-seven years they traveled life's journey together, sharing 
with each other the joys and sorrows, the adversities and prosperities of life. 
On the 2 1 St of March, 1899, however, the wife and mother was called to the 
home beyond. In the family were born: Sarah, the widow of John 
H. Bradley, of Philadelphia; Elizabeth H.; J. Hampton; Abner I., who is liv- 
ing in New York; and James L., who resides in lona. The influence which 
Aaron Leonard has exerted has ever been most marked. He has done much 
to uplift humanity and has ever been found the champion of all measures 
which tend to make men better and live happier. 

J. Hampton Leonard was born in Kossuth. Iowa, April 17, 1847, s"d 
began his education in the common schools at that place. He also pursued 
his studies in Danville. Iowa, in the Congregational Seminary of Chicago, 
and in the Union Theological Seminary of New York, but ill health forced 
him to put aside his text-books and he returned to the farm where he has 
since remained. He is now engaged in the nursery business and is a recog- 
nized leader in his line. The plants and trees which he sends out are of ex- 
cellent grade, and this, together with his reliability and honesty, has secured 
to him a liberal patronage. He is the vice-president of the American Dahlia 
Society of New Jersey. In church work he is very active and was the town- 
ship secretary of the Sunday-school Association. He has been the superin- 



COXGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 313 

tendent of the Sunday-school for a number of years and has labored most 
effectively to advance the cause of the church in which his father was pastor. 
A gentleman of sterling worth, of nobleness of character and upright life, he 
o-ained the respect of all with whom he came in contact. 



CHARLES CASSADAY. 

Charles Cassaday is one of the progressive farmers who have contributed 
so much to the prosperity of southern New Jersey, and resides in Upper Pitts- 
grove township. Salem county, this state, within a short distance of the spot 
that gave him birth, March 29, 1837. He was a son of Charles and Mary 
(Ayers) Cassaday and a grandson of James Cassaday. Charles Cassaday was 
a farmer of this region, who married Mary, a daughter of Robert Ayers, and 
(lied in 1841, leaving four children, two of whom are now living: Mary A., 
who is married ; and Charles, our subject. 

Charles Cassaday received a common-school education, attending dis- 
trict school during the winter and assisting in the farm duties during the 
summer. He showed a natural ability for agricultural life from his youth, 
and at the age of seventeen began to farm for himself, and was one of the 
most successful farmers of the community, using modem ideas to carry on 
his work and meeting with astonishing results almost unheard of by those 
who jogged along in the old ruts. He purchased land from time to time 
until he now has four farms, all in excellent condition, lying in Salem and 
Gloucester counties, his last purchase being in January, 1899, when he 
bought of the James S. Abbott estate fifty-one acres, where he has since 
carried on agricultural pursuits. His land aggregates two hundred and 
ninety acres, and, like his father, he is considered a model farmer, his judg- 
ment concerning land, crops, etc., being regarded as flawless. His success 
is attributable to his industry and perseverance and the indomitable will that 
carried him over obstacles that would have discouraged weaker men. He 
has built up a higher standard for the farmer and his example has proved a 
stimulant and incentive to them to accomplish greater results and emulate 
his methods. 

On the 22d of February, 1866, was celebrated the nuptials of ]\lr. Cassa- 
day and Miss Rebecca Ecrett, a daughter of Smith Ecrett, of this locahty. 
Four children were bom to them, namely: Joseph, of Pine Tavern; Smith, 
who farms the old homestead; Mary, who lives at home; and Rebecca E., 
the wife of Joseph Bills, and lives near here. Mr. Cassaday was reared in 
the atmosphere of a Christian home and imbibed those principles which, if 



314 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

practiced, lead to noJile manhood and womanhood. He united with the 
Methodist Episcopal church at Harding\ille. Gloucester county, this state, 
about thirty-nine years ago. and has been a faithful worker in the organiza- 
tion ever since, having been steward, trustee, class-leader and exhorter as the 
occasion demanded, and remaining true to the teachings received in the old 
school-house church of which his father was a member. Mr. Cassaday is a 
man of sterling worth and stands high in the esteem of his fellow men. 



IRA S. CHAMPION. 



The Atlantic coast of New Jersey has become a summer resort to which 
annuall}- many hundreds of people go, finding there rest and recreation from 
the cares and responsibilities of business and social life. To attend to the 
needs of these visitors many enterprises have been established, and of the 
control of one of which Mr. Champion lias charge. His efforts have largely 
contributed to the welfare and upbuilding of Ocean City, and his labors have 
not only brought him individual support but have been a factor in the pros- 
perity which has attended the city in which he makes his home. 

Numbered among the nati\-e sons of New Jersey, Mr. Champion was born 
in Pleasantville. Atlantic county, July 27. 1866, and is a son of Somers T. 
and Anna 'SI. (Lake) Champion. His grandfather. Elmer Champion, resided 
at Absecom. Atlantic county, and was a sea cajitain. His children were 
Elmer. Enoch. Daniel. Caroline, Jane, Ruhannah and Anna. The father 
of our subject obtained a common-school education, and has spent his entire 
life in New Jersey. Since 1880 he has been interested in seashore real estate, 
carrying on business at Atlantic Highlands. He was the superintendent and 
the secretary- of the Atlantic Highlands Association for about eight years, 
and he owns extensive real-estate interests there. He received the first deed 
for lands sold by the Ocean City Association, in May, 1880, and has been 
an important factor in the advancement of the beautiful towns which overlook 
the Atlantic. 

In his political views he is a strong Republican and his opinions carry 
weight in the councils of his party. He has labored earnestly to. insure its 
success, and for three years he served as the sergeant at arms in the New 
Jersej' senate. One of the most prominent and valued members of the order 
of Knights of Pythias, he is now occupying the position of grand chancellor,

memljer of Company B, Twenty-fifth New Jersey Infantry, he fohowed the 
stars and stripes upon southern battle-fields. The friendships which he 
formed in those days are still continued through the medium of the Grand 
Army Post. His religious belief is in harmony with the doctrines of the 
Methodist Episcopal church, of which he is accounted a representative mem- 
ber. He has held all of the church of^ces and has efficiently served as the 
superintendent of the Sunday-school. Mr. Champion married Miss Anna 
M. Lake, and they became the parents of eight children. — Frank E., who 
married Flora E. Risley. and has four children, — Benjamin, Jesse, Milton and

years; and the other three children died in infancy. The mother of these 
children was called to her final rest June 15, 1898. 

Ira S. Champion is indebted to the public-school system of Atlantic 
county for the early educational privileges which he received. Later he at- 
tended Pennington Seminary, and on the 4th of March, 1884, was graduated 
in Eastman's Business College. Thus well equipped for the responsible 
duties of life, he entered upon an acti\e commercial career in Ocean City, as 
the proprietor of a meat market and grocery. He afterward spent two years 
as a bookkeener for the firm of Strowbridge & Clother, of Philadelphia, and 
in 1889 came to Ocean City, where he has since been engaged in the manu- 
facture of ice cream for the seashore trade. He has prettily appointed par-

business as well, shipping to various points in Cape May county. He is 
also successfully engaged in business as a milk dealer, handling eighty thou- 
sand quarts of milk annually. He built his residence and place of business in 
1885, a substantial structure thirty-five by seventy feet. In addition to his 
other interests he is the manager of the Bell Telephone Company at Ocean

and in 1895-6 he served as a member of tlie cit}' council. Later he filled the 
position of city clerk, and at one time was a representative to the general 
assembly. The Republican party receives his allegiance and he frequently 
attends its conventions, where his counsels carry weight, for his opinions

CAPTAIN AUGUSTUS SOOY. 

The importance of the government life-saving service cannot be over- 
estimated, and year by year it is being systematized more perfectly. Cap- 
tain Augustus Sooy, who is the keeper of the Cold Spring station at Cape 
May city, is one of the most trusted and thoroughly efiicient employes in this 
department of our nation's work, and a history of his life will prove of inter- 
est to his hosts of friends. 

His paternal grandfather, Augustus Sooy, was born at Port Republic. 
New Jersey, was a sailor in early manhood, and during the war of the Revolu- 
tion owned a ship which was taken as a prize by the British, near Egg island, 
Delaware bay. His last years were devoted to the tilling of the soil, and no one 
in his community was more genuinely esteemed. He was a faithful member 
of the Methodist Episcopal church, and died, as he bad lived, strong in the 
the faith. He lived to reach his eightieth year, and his wife, Sarah (Higbee) 
Sooy, was about eighty-two years old at the time of her demise. Of their 
children, Samuel and Jesse were lost at sea when young men, and the latter 
left a widow and two daughters, — Elizabeth and Sarah. Joseph Chalkley and 
Josiah Higbee were the third and fourth children of Augustus Sooy. ^Nlaria, 
the eldest daughter, married James Clark, a farmer of Port Republic, and 
their son. Captain Thomas Clark, was drowned at sea. Another son. Captain 
Nathaniel D. Clark, was lost ofi the coast of Massachusetts, and Captain 
Harry also followed the sea. Captain Jesse Clark is living retired. The 
daughters of this family were Sarah, who married Joseph Turner: Louisa, 
wife of E. Addams; and Abbigil. Elizabeth, the second daughter of Augustus 
and Sarah (Higbee) Sooy, married John Turner, a farmer near Higbeetown. 
and their sons Peter and Samuel are farmers, while Richard, who is agent

for the Henry Diston estate, of Philadelphia, is a bank director, and resides 
in Atlantic City. Mary is the widow of Josiah Johnson, while Annie is the 
wife of Joseph Barstow, a leading merchant of Atlantic City, New Jersey: 
Rachel became the wife of Eli Bowen. since deceased, but then living at 
Smithville, New Jersey, and their children were Mary Jane Shaw Sooy and 
Captain John. 

Josiah H. Sooy, the father of our subject, was born at Port Republic and 
spent his entire life there, following the sea for several years as captain of 
a vessel and later carrying on a farm. He was a true patriot, a stanch Re- 
publican, and for many years he held one local position or another, with 
credit to himself and friends. A devoted member of the Methodist Episcopal 
church, he held several of its of^ces of trust and responsibility, and, being 
an ardent believer in temperance, he identified himself with the organization 
known as the Sons of Temperance. He was a successful business man. and 
at one time was connected with a building and loan association. He mar- 
ried Mary Smith and their union was blessed with four children. Rachel 
became the wife of William Johnson, a farmer of Port Republic, and they 
had seven children: Mary Belle, the eldest, married John English; Rosa is 
the wife of Roland Randolph, of Tuckerton, New Jersey, and has three chil- 
dren. Minnie Ray, George Elsworth and Flora: Alice is the wife of Captain 
James Abbott, of Port Townsend. and the mother of twin sons, — Richter 
and Ransford; Ellsworth, the eldest son of Rachel Johnson, is married and his 
only child died when young. He is a member of the wholesale grocery 
firm of Johnson Brothers, of San Francisco: Augustus S., who is a member of 
the firm of Johnson Brothers, married Caroline Lindeluf? and they had one 
child, Lloyd: Clara and Arthur are at home. The Captain is the second 
child of Josiah and Mary Sooy. Sarah J., the third child of Josiah and Mary 
Sooy, married Captain Eli Higbee Smith, of Philadelphia, and their only son, 
William, is a mate on a sea-going vessel: Samuel, not married, a part of the 
time is the mate and part of the time master, on a ship. The father of our 
subject departed this life on the 2gth of December, 1891, when in his eighty- 
third year. 

The birth of Captain Augustus Sooy occurred at Port Republic, Au- 
gust 8, 1838. He obtained what education he could before he was twelve 
years of age, and then went on board a two-masted schooner in a minor 
position, gradually working his way upward until he became the first mate 
on a coasting vessel. After serving as such for six years he became the 
master of a ship, and altogether he sailed the seas for eighteen years. In 
1 87 1 he joined the life-saving service, the local department being instituted 
that vear. He acted in minor capacities for several years, proving his ability

and bravery, and some thirteen years ago he was honored by l.ieing made 
the captain of the Cold Spring station. Here he has command of seven 
men, who are thoroughly drilled, heroic and trustworthy, and every year, 
during the great storms which prevail along this coast, their courage and 
eiificiencv is taxed to the utmost. The general public little realizes what a 
grand, remarkable work is in their hands, how many thousands of dollar? 
of marine property is annually saved, or how many precious lives are rescued 
from the angry deep by these devoted men, who have never been known to 
falter when duty called them. Too much cannot be said in their praise, nor 
too much credit given to their gallant commander. Captain Sooy. This 
station, one of the most important on the New Jersey coast, which has forty- 
two stations, is a fine example of modern ideas in connection with the saving 
of lives endangered on the ocean. All mechanical devices and appliances to 
aid the little band of stalwart workers in this humane task are to be found 
here. 

Augustus Sooy's work has indeed been of great importance. In \8/2 
he and his men were instrumental in saving the crew of the schooner known 
as the Carrie S. Webb, when off the cape, and in connection with Robert 
Chambers he volunteered to take the schooner to New York. The vessel 
was in distress and started for the metropolis. They had almost reached 
harbor when a storm drove them again to sea and for fifteen days they drifted 
in the gale. When they at length reached land they found they were twenty 
miles north of Cape Hatteras and the crew were almost in despair, but finally 
the}' reached Charleston, South Carolina. On another occasion Captain 
Sooy went to the rescue of the vessel Clara Davidson on Cold Spring bar. 
On the ship was a crew of six men, together with three passengers, a lady 
and her two children ; but after gallantly working for many hours in the cold 
and ice, he and his helpers succeeded in saving the entire number. Many 
are those who owe to him a debt of gratitude which can never l)e repaid. 
Man's most priceless possession is life, and through the efforts of Captain 
Sooy this has been given to many who else would have found death in a 
waterv grave. Fearless and true, he never falters when duty calls, but with 
a heroism that is sublime goes forth to rescue the imperiled ones. He takes 
no great credit to himself for this, saying that it is merely his duty; but such 
a record cannot fail to awaken the gratitude and admiration of all. 

The marriage of Captain Sooy and Miss Fannie Smith was solemnized 
September 21, 1864. Mrs. Sooy is daughter of George and Naomi (Leeds) 
Smith and granddaughter of Isaac Smith, whd was the sheriff of Atlantic 
coimty and whose home was at Smithville, a place named in honor of his 
family. He had nine children, — Henry, Mark, Louis, John, Thomas, George. 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEIV JERSEY. 319 

Martha, Susanna and Pitman. George W. Smith was born and reared at 
Smithville, and early in Hfe was an oysterman and sailed the seas. His last 
years were spent at Leeds Point, where he died at the age of forty-two. He 
had several children, namely: Bodine C, Fannie M., Josiah L.. Susie C, 
Clayton L. and Ehvood. Leeds Point was named in honor of Mrs. Sooy's 
maternal grandfather. Captain Clayton Leeds, who resided there all of his 
lifetime, besides being the owner of a number of vessels was blessed with 
considerable wealth. He was a Whig and Republican and took a patriotic 
interest in the triumph of his party. To himself and wife, Mary, were born 
Captain Mark, who was lost at sea; Louisa, the wife of Captain Nicholas 
Endicott; Naomi; Josiah, who went to Oregon, engaged in the lumber busi- 
ness and died a wealthy man; :Mima, who first became the wife of Captain 
Alfred Higbee, the master of a sea-going vessel, who died; later she wedded 
Joseph Frampus, a teacher, and now is the wife of Fred Chamberlain, a 
farmer of Absecon, New Jersey : she lives in California; and Esther, the wife of 
Josiah Bowen, who was engaged in the oyster business, his home being at 
Smithville. Mr. and Mrs. Sooy had four children, but their daughters. 
Laura and Fannie May, both died when fourteen months old, and Flora 
was called from the happy family circle by the angel of death when she was 
twenty years of age. Josiah, their only son. alone remains to cheer their 
declining days. 

Like his ancestors. Captain Sooy is a noble Christian man, his preference 
being for the Methodist Episcopal church. Fraternally he belongs to the 
American Order of United Workmen and formerly was connected with the 
Knights of Pythias lodge. His has been a noble life, one worthy of emula- 
tion, and to his son he will leave that priceless heritage,— a good name. 



W^ILLLAM E. FORCUM. 

William E. Forcum, who is engaged in the painting business at Holly 
Beach, Avas born in Philadelphia. July 31, 1852, his parents being Elias and 
Anna B. (Evans) Forcum. The name is of Welsh and English origin. The 
father of our subject was born in Delaware, and afterward resided in Penn- 
sylvania and Virginia, spending his last days in the latter state, his death 
occurring in 1856, at the age of forty. He was a sailor and followed the seas 
for many years. His widow is still living and has reached the advanced age 
of seventy-five years. They were the parents of Hester. Anna. William E. 
and Elias W' . 

In the public schools of Delaware William E. Forcum pursued his educa- 



320 



BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



tion until eleven years of age, and then began work as a farm hand, which 
he followed for some time. Subsequently he went to Philadelphia, where he 
learned the house-painter's trade and has since devoted his energies to that 
pursuit. In 1882 he came to Holly Beach and has since contracted in the 
line of his chosen vocation, furnishing employment to a dozen men and re- 
ceiving from the public a liberal patronage. He also engaged in renting 
houses and is one of the industrious, energetic business men of the town. 

Mr. Forcum is taking a deep interest in public afifairs and has been ac- 
tively concerned in the government of the town. He served as postmaster 
for two years, was a member of the city council for two years and is now 
for a second term holding that office. He was collector for three years, has 
been a school trustee and was the mayor of the village in 1887, 1888. 1889 
and 1892. 

On the 5th of November, 1875, Mr. Forcum was united in marriage to 
Miss Elizabeth Jane Siver, and their children are Elizabeth. x\nna, Hester, 
Nellie, Charles, Carrie, Rebecca, William and Fannie. The fourth daughter, 
Nellie, and three other children are now deceased. Mr. Forcum may well be 
termed a self-made man, for since his early youth he has been dependent upon 
his own exertions, and whatever he has achieved in life is due entirely to 
his well directed efforts. 



IS.\.\C SWAIN. 



Isaac Swain is a son of Isaac and Mary (Savage) Swain, and was born in 
Middle township. Cape May county, June 4, 1831. He attended the pubHc 
schools of that locality and also a private school at Cape May Court House, 
and when nineteen years of age he began the task of mastering the more 
difficult lessons in the school of experience. He spent one year pros- 
pecting in Illinois and then went to sea. sailing as one of the crew on a 
schooner engaged in the coasting trade. For three years he was identified 
with seafaring life and during much of that time served as mate on a ves- 
sel. In 1885, attracted by the discovery of gold in California, he made his 
way to the Pacific slope, where he engaged in mining for two and a half 
years. In 1858 he returned to New Jersey and located at Swainton. upon a 
farm of two hundred and fifty acres. Since that time he has carried on agri- 
cultural pursuits. He has also been engaged in general merchandising for 
twenty years and has Isought and sold wood and lumber on an extensive 
scale. For thirty-one years he dealt in furs, doing a large business in that 
line, purchasing all of the furs that were secured in Cape May and Cumber- 
land counties. In whatever line of business he has directed his energies he 



CONGRESSIOXAL DiSTmCT OF NEJV JERSEY. 321 

has met with success, for he possesses undaunted determination and unflag- 
ging energy, — qualities which never fail to secure the desired financial re- 
ward. 

On the 6th of December, 1858. Mr. Swain was united in marriage to IMiss 
Emma Hand, a daughter of Charles and Abigail (Willetts) Hand. They 
became the parents of four children, but two are now deceased, — Charles P., 
who died at the age of thirty-one years: and Luther, who died in infancy. 
Jennie F., the eldest of the family, married Charles AVay, a merchant of 
South Seaville, New Jersey. Luther M., the youngest of the family, was 
married March 5, 1896, to Ida Cresse. He is assisting his father in his busi- 
ness and is also extensively engaged in the raising of poultry and pigeons. 
He served as postmaster of Swainton during President Cleveland's adminis- 
tration and is one of the representative citizens of his community. Possessing 
much musical ability, he is a member of the Cape May band and has at dif- 
ferent times played upon all the various instruments in the organization. 

Mr. Swain, of this review, is a stanch advocate of Democratic principles 
and has held a number of township offices. He was formerly a member of 
the township committee and for twenty-two years has been a justice of the 
peace. He belongs to Cannon Lodge, F. & A. M., at South Seaville and was 
at one time a member of the Grange. He has been true to every trust re- 
posed in him by his fellow townsmen and discharges his official duties with 
marked promptness and fidelity. 



ALFRED R. KAXDLE. 

Alfred R. Kandle is one of the wealthy agriculturists of Gloucester county 
and has arisen to this position in financial circles entirely by his own labors. 
Starting out in life empty-handed, he has steadily worked his way upward, 
overcoming all difficulties and obstacles in his path by determined purpose 
and resolute will. His unflagging energy has brought to him prosperity 
and to-dav he is the owner of valuable farm land and of two sawmills which 
add to the commercial activity of the community as well as to his individual 
prosperity. 

The life historv of Mr. Kandle cannot fail to prove of interest to many of 
our readers, for he is both widely and favorably known throughout this sec- 
tion of New Jersey. He was born in Pittsgrove, Salem county. May 13- 
1 85 1. His father, Adam Kandle, was also a native of the same locality, and 
the grandfather, also named Adam, was born in that place. The family is of 
German lineage and was founded in America by the great-grandfather. The 



322 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

father of our subject was a farmer by occupation, following that pursuit 
throughout his business career. He served as a township committeeman 
and was also a freeholder. His wife, who bore the maiden name of Hannah 
Potter, was a daughter of ^Michael Potter, and was born near Pittsgrove. 
Salem county. Her father was a well known hunter and fanner and served 
his country in the war of 1812. He lived to the advanced age of one hun- 
dred and eight years. Unto Adam and Hannah Kandle were bom six chil- 
dren, five of whom are living, namely: John M.. a resident of Gloucester City. 
Xew Jersey; Joseph A., of Monroeville; A. R.; Adam P.. who makes his 
home in Vineland; and Harriett E.. the wife of Stephen Crane, of \Mllow 
Grove. 

A. R. Kandle attended the country schools throughout the winter months 
and in the summer season aided in the work of the farm. In that manner 
his boyhood days were passed and in 1878 he began business on his own 
account by opening a store in Porchtown, Franklin township, Gloucester 
county, where he carried on general merchandise for four years. Taking up 
his abode on the old homestead in Pittsgrove. he resided there until 1887. 
when he came to his present farm in \\'ashington township, near Glassboro. 
He also has a sawmill there, and his farm comprises eighty-seven acres of 
valuable land, which is under a high state of cultivation. He also has one 
hundred and thirty-five acres in another tract and operates his two mills. 
His agricultural and industrial interests yield to him a handsome income and 
have gained him a position among the wealthy men of his county. His 
marked success is most creditable and his life demonstrates what can be ac- 
complished through determined purpose. 

Mr. Kandle was united in marriage to Miss Georgiana Crane, a daughter 
of Moses Crane, of Gloucester county, the wedding taking place on the 13th 
of March. 1878. Their union has been blessed with five children, of whom 
four are Hving: Osceola. \'olney B.. Clinton 'SI. and West J.. — all still under 
the paternal roof. 

In his political affiliations Mr. Kandle is a Democrat and has taken an 
active interest in politics, doing all in his power to promote the growth and 
insure the success of his party. He has been a township committeeman, 
has served on the board of education, and in the spring of 1899 was elected 
freeholder, being the present incumbent. His church relations are with the 
Methodist Episcopal organization at Pittman Grove, and he is now serving as 
a steward of the church and the superintendent of the Sunday-school. He 
is a member of the Knights of the Golden Eagle and of the Junior Order of 
American ilechanics, and has been through all the chairs of the latter organi- 
zation. He commands the respect of his fellow men by his fidelitv to dutv 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEIV JERSEY. 323 

in all the relations of life. In his business dealings he is straightforward and 
honorable, and in the work of the church and in public office he is faithful and 
loval. He well deser\'es representation in this volume and it is with pleasure 
that we present the record of his life to our readers. 



TORN BLACK. 



This honored and venerable citizen of Gloucester county is still actively 
-'dentified with farming interests in \\'oolwich township, where he owns two 
hundred acres of valuable land. His identification with business affairs after 
passing the eightieth milestone on life's journey is an indication of the in- 
dustry and enterprise which have ever been numbered among his chief char- 
acteristics, and should put to shame many a younger man, who, grown weary 
of the struggles and trials of business life, would relegate to others the 
burdens which he should bear. 

;\Ir. Black was born in county Tyrone, Ireland, June 16, 1819, and is a 
son of William and .\gnes (Craig) Black. His father was an extensive 
farmer and flax-grower, and in that business the subject of this review as- 
sisted until twenty years of age. In 1839 he came to the United States, hop- 
ing to better his condition in the Xew World, where superior advantages 
were otfered to ambitious young men. He soon secured employment of 
Samuel Deull, who resided near Harrisonville, New Jersey, remaining with 
him for a year. He afterward spent a year and a half in the employ of Ben- 
jamin P. Lippincott, with whom he continued for ten years. On the expira- 
tion of that period he purchased thirty acres of wild land, then in a primitive 
condition, but with characteristic energy he began its improvement, clearing 
the place of the heavy timber with which it was covered. He cut down trees 
in order to make room for the house, and day after day continued the work 
of improvement until the entire tract was transformed into rich and fertile 
fields. Not long after his arrival he purchased an additional forty acres, and 
has since added to the place until the farm now comprises two hundred 
acres of rich and valual)le land. During the time that he was clearing and 
paving for the property Mr. Black frecpiently worked all night. He has 
ever been a most industrious man, and even yet is capable of performing 
a hard day's work in the field. His unabating industry has brought to him 
very creditable success and his property stands as a monument to his thrift 
and enterprise. 

On the 6th of September. 185 1, Mr. Black was united in marriage to 
Miss Ruth Polston, a daughter of John Polston. She had formerlv been a 



524 



BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



member of the Lippincott houselioUl. Her married life was of short dura- 
tion, for after four years she was called to the home beyond, leaving two 
children, — Joseph and Alfred. The former, who resides on one of his father's 
farms, married Laura Wescott, of Woodstown, and has five children, namel\f 
Ruth, Norris, Elizabeth, Fred and Sadie. Alfred, who wedded Mary Burns, 
of Woodstown, and has two children, Elsie and John, is also living on one of 
his father's farms. 

]\Ir. Black, of this review, has spent his entire life, since his twentieth year, 
in Gloucester county, and has ever commanded the respect and esteem w hich 
is given to men of sterling worth. In the evening of life he is crowned with 
veneration and regard, and while he has attained a handsome competence 
he has also won that good name which is rather to be chosen than great 
riches. 



H. P. FRIES. 



The kingdom of Denmark has furnished to America some of their most 
worthy citizens, men who in the active affairs of life have occupied important 
and prominent positions. The enterprise and perseverance which are so 
characteristic of the Danish nation are found exemplified in the subject of 
this review. He was born in Denmark, January 13. 1848. and is the son of 
O. M. Fries, who was also a native of that land and belonged to a prominent 
family there. The father devoted his energies to agricultural pursuits and 
s]5ent his entire life in Denmark. He held a number of local offices, and was 
a faithful and consistent member of the Lutheran church. His wife bore 
the maiden name of Mattie Peterson, and her death occurred in Denmark 
ill 1887. Two years later the father passed away. They were the parents 
of six children, of whom three are living. H. P., of this re\iew; P. P., of 
California: and Mrs. Mettie K. Tigerson, of Denmark. 

In the local schools of his native land H. P. Fries was educated and then 
learned the trade of millwright. In 1872 he determined to try his fortune in 
America, hoping to improve his financial condition in a land w'here oppor- 
tunity is open to all who have ambition and energy. He worked on farms 
at different places and was also connected with the oyster business for a time. 
By his industry and economy he was enabled to save some capital and in 
1876 he came to Gloucester county and purchased his present farm, com- 
prising some forty-six acres of rich land. This is now under a high state of 
cultivation and adds materially to the income of the owner. In 1880 he also 
embarked in merchandising in Janvier. In 1898 he purchased a rug factory, 
which he has since successfully operated. He is a man of excellent business 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NIUV JERSEY. 325 

and executive aljility an.l carries to successful comiiletion wliatever he under- 
takes. 

Mr. Fries was married on the 17th of March. 1876. Miss Hannah b . 
Barnes l^econiin- his wife. She is a daughter of Edgar Barnes, of Janvier, 
and l:)y her marriage is the mother of three children: Olah, who is conduct- 
ing a rug factory; Fred, who makes his home in Kansas City: and ?^Iattie. 
who is with her parents. The family attend the Presbyterian church, of 
which Mr. Fries is an active and influential member. He served as the sujier- 
intendent of the Sunday-school, and has actively labored for the growth and 
upbuilding of the church. The cause of education also finds in him a warm 
friend, and his efforts as school trustee resulted in advancing the standard 
of schools in this locality. He may truly be called a self-made man. for he 
came to the New World without capital and by the exercise of diligence and 
sound judgment he has worked his way steadily upward to a position of af- 
fluence, being now numliered among the substantial citizens of the com- 
munity.

path from Cape May Court House to Cape May city. He has always lived in 
this locality, and has ever given a commendable support to enterprises and 
measures calculated to prove a public benefit. His own life record has been

JOHN M. MOORE. 

To no man is the prosperity and advancement of Clayton due in a greater 
degree than to John M. Moore, who is to-day at the head of a very important 
industry, conducted under the name of the Moore Brothers' Glass Works. 
This concern has been a very important factor in the upbuilding and progress 
of the town, for the welfare of the community depends upon its commercial 
and industrial activities, and in the glass-works employment is furnished to 
several hundred operatives. The enterprise yields to the owners a handsome 
income which is well merited, for they have risen through their own efforts 
to positions of prominence in the business world and their success is liut a 
just reward for their labors. 

John M. Moore was born in Bridgeton, Cumberland county. New Jer- 
sey, Januar}' i, 1827. He pursued his education in the common schools, but 
at an early age put aside his text-books and when a young man of nineteen 
years left home, going to Millville, New Jersey, where he remained for 
twelve years. He there learned the business of the manufacture of glass, 
and on the expiration of that period trav.eled across the continent, spending 
one year in California. In the winter of 1855 ^"^ 1856 he came to Clayton 
and purchased a glass factory of one who had failed in business. After a 
few months he was joined by his brother Wilson and on a small scale they 
began operations, having but one furnace. Their trade, however, has stead- 
ily increased, and in order to meet the growing demands they have increased 
their facilities until the plant is now equipped with five furnaces and all of the 
latest improvements and machinery needed in their lines. They manufacture 
•green glass bottles, and employ five hundred men and boys. From time to 
time they have extended the field of their business, and in connection with 
their glass factories they conduct a gristmill and sawmill and a machine 
shop. Their varied interests have been a means of largely increasing the 
population of Clayton, which has grown from a town of three hundred to 
three thousand people. Many of these have come to Clayton to work in 
the factories and mills owned by Mr. Moore, and this is now a prosperous 
and thriving community, for he pays good wages to his employes and treats 
them with all due consideration. He is also a director in the Millville Na- 



330 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

tional Bank, a director in the West Jersey & Seashore Railroad Company, 
and is the owner of one thousand acres of vahiable land which is devoted to 
general farming and to the raising of vegetables. 

June 4, 1863. was celebrated the marriage of John M. ^loore and Ellen 
R. Morgan, a daughter of Samuel Morgan, of Salem county. They became 
the parents of eight children, of whom six are living: Cornelia F.. Anna E.. 
Lydia M.. Laura D.. Edwin K.. and Florence. The son has studied medi- 
cine and is now resident physician in the German hospital in Philadelphia. 

Mr. Moore takes quite an active interest in town matters and has been 
judge of the court for five years. He is also a trustee of the Presbyterian 
church and gives his aid and active co-operation to all mo\-ements calculated 
to prove of public benefit. He is a very prominent Mason, belonging to For- 
est Grove Lodge, No. gi. of Clayton; Siloam Chapter. R. A. AL. of 
Camden: and to the Scottish Rite, in which he has attained the Thirty-second 
degree. 

His life stands in evidence of the possibilities that are open to young men 
in America. The qualities which here secure advancement may be cultivated 
by all. for success depends upon close application, careful management and 
sound judgment. These have been the salient points in the character of Mr. 
Moore and have won him most signal success. 



BEN'JAMIX \^"EIT.^L\X. 

Benjamin W'ellman. who is engaged in the grocery business in West Cape 
May. is a son of David and Amanda (Fox) ^^'ellman, and was born in Wood- 
bury, Litchfield county, Connecticut, October 8, 1842. The Wellman family 
is of Welsh origin and was founded in America by three brothers of the name 
who crossed the Atlantic, taking up their abode in New England. To the 
common-school system of this land Benjamin Wellman is indebted for the 
educational privileges he received. His boyhood days were spent on the 
home farm, where he early became familiar with all the duties and labors- 
that fall to the lot of the agriculturist. When the tocsin of war was sounded, 
however, he left his plow and responded to the country's call for troops, en- 
listing in the Nineteenth Regiment of Connecticut \'olunteers know-n as the 
Second Heavy Artillery. He participated in many hotly contested engage- 
ments, including the battles of North Anna River and Cold Harbor. He en- 
tered the army as a private and was promoted to the rank of quartermaster 
and afterward to commissary-sergeant. While taking part in the operations 
before Petersburg he was wounded and confined in the hospital from June 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEU' JERSEY. 331 

until December. At the l^attle of Cold Harbor a musket ball passed through 
his cheek and came out back of his ear. While thus lying on the ground, 
wounded, another ball struck him in the dorsal vertebrae, and while he was 
still upon the field two rebels came up to him. asked him what regiment he 
belonged to and offered him some water, but soon afterwanl two lumdred of 
the Confederate troops came that way and stepped over him as he lay on the 
ground, wounded and sultering! For about fifteen hours he thus remained 
upon the battle-field, and was then taken to the hospital, where he remained 
for six months., On the expiration of that period he rejoined his old com- 
mand in front of Petersburg, started with it in pursuit of Lee. and was pres- 
ent at the surrender at Appomattox on the 12th of April. 1865. His com- 
mand then marched to Bunkerville. and with the First Division of the -Sixth 
Army Corps went to Danville. After two weeks they returned to Richmond 
and were encamped at Manchester, opposite Richmond, for a time, but sub- 
sequently moved northward to Washington, D. C, a march of one hundred 
and fort\- miles. His regiment was discharged at Woodbury. New Haven, 
about the close of the war. and from the state service at Fair Haven. Connec- 
ticut. Of the forty-five men who joined the army from his town at the time 
of his enlistment only thirteen returned, and seventy-five per cent of the men 
of the regiment were either killed or wounded in battle. At the battle of 
Cold Harbor the regiment numbered eighteen hundred, and at its close there 
were between three and four hundred men who had laid down their lives on 
the altar of their countrw They also sustained very heavy losses in the 
Shenandoah valley, but Mr. Wellman was among those fortunate enough to 
escape, and with an honoralile war record he returned to the north, receivmg 
his discharge on July 7. 1S65. 

A\'hen hostilities had ceased Mr. Wellman became a resident of Vineland. 
New Jersey, and for a time was connected with business interests there. He 
is now engaged in the grocery business in West Cape May. where he has a 
well appointed store, carrying a large and complete line of staple and fancy 
groceries. In his dealing he is honorable and straightforward, and his 
known reliability, combined with h.is uniform courtesy to his patrons, has 
secured him a large trade. His political support is given to the Prohibition 
party, of which he is an inflexible adherent, being very zealous and active in 
its interests. He has served as school trustee, but has never been an of^ce- 
seeker. preferring to devote his time and attention to his business interests. 
He is a valued member of the John Mecray Post. No. 40. G. A. R.. with 
which he has been connected for fifteen years, during which time he has filled 
all of its offices. » 

On the jCith of December, 1870. Mr. Wellman was united in marriage to

JOSHUA WADDINGTON. 

For many years this gentleman was connected with the agricultural inter- 
ests of Salem count}-; and is now living retired in the city of Salem, enjoying 
a rest which he has truly earned and richly deserves. His life is an exemplifi- 
cation of what may be accomplished through determined purpose and unabat- 
ing industry. 

Mr. Waddington is a native of Salem county, his birth having occurred 
in Elsinboro township, March 13, 1820. He is a son of Aaron and Sarah

the community in which he resided, enjoyed the public confidence in a re- 
markable degree and was frequently called upon to settle estates and transact 
business for the county. He had five children, — William. Jesse, Anna. Martha 
and Hannah. Robert ^^'addington, the second son of Jonathan Wadding- 
ton, married a Miss Tomlinson, of Camden, New Jersey, and died in early

tieth year. 

Aaron Waddington, the father of our subject, was liorn in the village of 
Salem, in November, 1780. After arriving at years of maturity he ran the 
old homestead farm and was the owner of a valuable tract of land at the time 
of his death. In his political affiliations he was a ,Whig. He attended the 
meetings of the Hicksite Friends, being a firm believer in the faith of that 
society, and he contributed liiDerally to its support and did all in his power to 
promote its growth and progress. He married Sarah Keasby, and by their 
union were born five children, nameh': Sarah Ann, the eldest, who was born 
in 18 16 and became the wife of John Vining Hill, a carriage-maker of Salem, 
by whom she had three children.^ — Sarah Ellen, Anna and John Vining, the 
latter a resident of Philadelphia. Mrs. Hill died in 1889. Lydia Keasby. who 
was born in October, 1818, married Jonathan S. AVhite, a son of Samuel

children whose history we have thus briefly given, died April 7, 1842. at the 
age of sixty-two years. The mother passed away in September, 1828, in her 
thirty-fifth year. 

Joshua Waddington spent his boyhood days in the township of his na- 
tivity and obtained his education in a private school conducted by the Society 
of Friends. He put aside his text-books at the age of twenty and returned to 
the work of the farm, with which he had become familiar through practical 
experience in his early youth. He assisted his father in the operation of the 
old homestead until his death and then succeeded to its ownership, operating 
it successfully until 1879, when he returned to ]3rivate life. He followed most 
progressive methods in his agricultural pursuits, and neatness and thrift 
characterized all departments of the farm labor. His well tilled fields yielded 
to him a golden tribute in return for the care and labor he bestowed upon 
them, and when the capital he had acquired made it jjossiljle for him to put 
aside the more arduous duties of business life he came to Salem, where he 
has since rested in the enjoyment of the fruits of his former toil. In 1883 he 
erectetl a lieautiful brick residence whicli stands on a lawn of about three-

party and on its dissolution joined the ranks of the Republican party. He is 
now, however, a strong advocate of the Prohibition party, and by his ballot 
supports its men and measures. He is a man of firm convictions, unfaltering 
in their support, and is at all times true and loyal to a cause in which he 
believes. He has been honored with a number of local offices, the duties of 
which he has discharged with marked fidelity and ability. His entire life 
has been passed in Salem county, and his career has been a most honorable 
and upright one, which is indicated by the fact that many who have known 
him from bovhood are now numbered among his warmest friends.

the defense of the American ports. He is a Republican in his political affilia- 
tions, but has never sought or desired office, preferring to devote his energies 
and time to his business interests. He has so conducted his affairs as to win 
a very creditable degree of success and is now the possessor of a comfortable 
competence. He started out in life for himself at a veiy early age and has 
met difficulties and obstacles, but has overcome these by determined purpose, 
and his career is an exemplification of the opportunity that America oft'ers 
to her ambitious sons.

Xo life record pro\-es more conclusively that success is not a matter of 
genius, but is the result of indefatigable and sustained effort, and that it 
may be acquired by any one who cares to exercise diligence and perseverance, 
than does the history of Mr. Ogden, of Barnsboro. He was born at Willow 
Grove, Salem county, April 2, 1840, and is a son of John Ogden, who was 
a native of the same place and died in 1856. Having been left motherless 
during his earliest infancy, J. T. Ogden, when only four months old, was 
adopted by Samuel P. Tice, a resident of Williamstown, and when twelve 
years of age accompanied his foster father to Barnsboro. He was educated 
in the common schools, acquiring a good practical knowledge of the English 
branches of learning, but in his youth his time was largely devoted to farm 
work. When only fifteen years of age he was employed on the turnpike, 
and sometimes acted as toll-gate keeper. From 1856 to 1861 he was assist- 
ant supervisor of the toll road, and in 1865 he was again appointed super- 
visor. In 1877 he was made superintendent of the road between Glassboro and 
Mantua. No resident of the community has done more toward securing good 
roads than he, and good roads are a most important factor in all public inter- 
ests, for both commercial and industrial activities depend largely upon them. 
Mr. Ogden is now the owner of the farm of sixty-five acres and his property 
is a monument to his industry and enterprise. 

The subject of this review has been twice married, his first union being 
with Anna Hulings, who died in 1884, leaving a daughter, Emma L. In 
1887 Mr. Ogden was again married, his second union Ijeing with Charlotta 
Locke, of Bridgeport, New Jersey. The\- also ha\e one daughter, F-lor- 
ence A. 

Mr. Ogden has always been a loyal citizen and hardly had the guns of 
Fort Sumter been fired when he offered his services to the government as a 
defender of the Union. He was the first volunteer from this locality, going to 
Camden on the 20th of April and there joining the Washington Greys, which 



CONGRESSICXAL DISTRICT OF NEJr JERSEY. 337 

became Company F. Fourth New Jersey Infantry. The regiment was com- 
manded by Colonel Rich Miller, and Mr. Ogden continued at the front 
during his three months' term of service. At about the completion of that 
period his father died and he was obliged to return home. In 1863 he was 
made deputy marshal of the district and also served as the recruiting officer 
for his township until the close of the war. In politics he has always espoused 
the cause of the Republican party, which stood so loyally by the nation dur- 
ing the dark days of the civil war. and which has ever advocated the most 
progressive measures. He has served as notary public since 1886. for three 
terms, from 1866 until 1881 was justice of the peace, in 1887 was elected 
freeholder, was for twenty-one years a member of the school board, during 
the old law, and for seven terms has been a trustee. His public duties have 
ever been discharged with marked promptness and ability, thus gaining 
him the confidence and esteem of all concerned. Socially he is connected 
with the Odd Fellows Society and the Improved Order of Red Men. Of the 
former he is a charter member and has filled all of the lodge offices. Through- 
out his career he has manifested the same loyal spirit which prompted him to 
enlist under the stars and stripes in defense of the Union. 



AMARIAH F. OLIVER. 



A. F. Oliver, of Williamstown, was born in \\'rightstown, New Jersey, 
September 18. 1856. His father, Joseph K. Cliver, was also a native of that 
locality, as was the grandfather, Joseph Cliver, Sr. The family originated 
in Germany and at an early day was established on American soil. Joseph 
K. Cliver is a farmer by occupation and during the civil war loyally served 
his country as a defender of the Union. He still resides in Wrightstown, at 
the age of eightv-one years, and personally superintends the management 
of the farm. He married Hannah Asay, a daughter of Samuel Asay. of Ger- 
man extraction, and she is still living, at the age of seventy-two years. :\Ir. 
and Mrs. Cliver became the parents of nine children, of whom five survive: 
Samuel, a resident of .\sbury Park. New Jersey: David, who is living in 
Camden: Joseph, also a resident of Asbury Park: George, who makes his 
home in South Aml)oy. New Jersey: and A. F. 

The subject of this review attended the common schools until the age of 
seventeen years, and then learned the blacksmith's trade, which he has since 
followed as a source of livelihood. In 1880 he came to Williamstown and 
established a blacksmith and wagon shop, manufacturing wagons in addi- 
tion to his work at the blacksmith trade. He is very energetic and his able 



338 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

workmanship and honorable deaHng have secured to him a hberal patronage. 
On the 29th of December, 1884. Mr. Cliver was imited in marriage to 
Miss Laura Husted, the daughter of Charles W. Husted, a prominent citizen 
of Williamstown, who for twenty years sensed as justice of the peace. One 
child has been bom of their union, R. Clififord. The family are members of 
the Methodist Episcopal church, of which Mr. Cliver is trustee. He is con- 
nected with a number of civic societies, belonging to the Masonic fraternity, 
of which he is now serving as treasurer; the Knights of Pythias, the Junior 
Order of American Mechanics, the Improved Order of Red Men, the Ancient 
Order of Knights of the jMystic Chain, and the Ancient Order of United 
\\'orkmen; and in a number of these has held various ofifices. He was a char- 
ter member of WiUiamstown Lodge, of F. & A. ^L, and its present master. 
Mr. Cliver is a direct descendant of Robert Elwell, who came to New Eng- 
land in Winthrop's company of early Massachusetts settlers. In politics Mr. 
Cliver is a Republican, and in 1897 was elected tax collector, which position 
he is now filling. In all the relations of life he has been true to his duties as 
a man and a citizen and has won the good will of all with whom he has come 
in contact. 



HENRY COOMBS. 



Henr}' Coombs, a farmer of Elmer, Salem county, and ex-member of the 
legislature of this district, was born ^lay 25, 1842, within a stone's throw of 
the house in which he now resides. His father was James and his grandfather 
George Coombs, both of whom were natives of his city and are buried in the 
Presbyterian churchyard at Daretown, as have been past generations of the 
Coombs family for more than a century. 

They were of Irish descent, and the father, James, was considered one 
of the best men of the township and took a leading part in all local afifairs, 
settled many estates and held a number of offices within the gift of the peo- 
ple. He was the township superintendent of schools several years, doing all 
in his power to advance educational interests, and at the earnest entreaty of 
his friends allowed his name to be used as a candidate for assemblyman, but 
was defeated. He was public-spirited and always found in the lead of each 
and ever}- movement looking to the advancement of local matters. It was 
largely through his influence and enterprise that the West Jersey Railroad 
was put through here with its attendant facilities for travel and markets. He 
was a strong temperance advocate and one of the leaders of the movement. 
Formerly a AN hig, he later became identified with the Republican party and 
cast his vote with that organization. He was not a member of anv religious

denomination, yet he was a regular attendant at the Presl)yterian churcli. and 
his life was simple and honest. In this world's goods he possessed a com- 
fortable portion and was a large land-owner. The lady to whom he was 
united in marriage was ^liss Henrietta DuBois. who died in 1862. She 
was the mother of his nine children, four of whom are still living. He passed 
to the better land in 1886. One son, Albert, entered the civil war as a member 
of the Twelfth Xew Jersey \^olunteers in 1862, and died in the hospital soon 
afterward. The surviving members of the family are: Alary, who married 
Henry Applegate, a sea captain, who makes his home on the old homestead; 
Edwin, who is a justice of the jieace of Elmer: Henrv. our subject; and (Oliver, 
who is a storekeeper on the F^enns^'h'ania Railroad in jersev Citw 

Henry Coombs attended school one-half mile from the farm he now 
occupies, and when his schooling was finished he took up farm work as the 
most agreeable and independent life that seemed to be offered to him. In 
1867 he rented the farm upon which he now lives and continued to, be a ten- 
ant on that property until the death of his father, when he bought the land, 
two hundred acres, and carried on general farming. He has one of the 
finest dairies in the state, composed of fifty high-grade Jersey cows, and it is 
a matter of extreme satisfaction to Mr. Coombs that his cattle are the equal 
of any high-grade Jerseys. He \\ as one of the first men to see the advantage 
offered by this line of business and take advantage of it, giving his patrons a 
pure, wholesome article, and in return realizing a handsome income for the 
time and labor expended. He is justly proud of the milk he places on the 
market, aiming for the best and keeping only animals that have a good butter 
record. He has become a veteran in this Hne and has supplied one man who 
lives in Camden with milk for upward of twenty years. It is a pleasure to 
visit his dairy and stables and note the system and cleanliness with which the 
work is carried on, the greatest care being exercised at every point from the 
time the milk is taken from the cow. when it is strained and cooled, until it 
is ready for the wagon to be taken to town. Every ])recaution is used to 
keep it in first-class conflition for consumption. 

January 26, 1870, occurred the marriage of Henry Coomlis and Aliss 
Lizzie Hitchner. a daughter of Daniel Hitchner, of Pittsgrove township. 
Three children have been the honor of this union: Henrietta, who died at 
the age of six months; .Mljert, an inmate of his parental household: and J. 
Howard, now a pupil at Pierce's College in Philadelphia. Mr. Coombs is a 
stanch Republican and has been one of the leaders in the local organization, 
serving on the township committee since 1867. He was elected to the 
assembly in 1881-2-3, and was the first to represent the county alone, there 
having been two assemblymen irn'or to liis term of of^ce. He received a 



340

flattering majority, running far ahead of his ticket. As a member of that 
body he served as a member of the committee on agriculture. In 1897 he was 
appointed by the governor to fill an unexpired term as the surrogate, but 
was defeated for that office at the following election. He is a meml^er of the 
Methodist Episcopal church of this village, having served as a steward for 
years. He is also the superintendent of the Jefferson Sunday-school and 
has been the means of increasing not only the attendance but also the interest 
in the school until it is now one of the most flourishing here. He is a pros- 
perous, progressive citizen who occupies an enviable place in the esteem of 
his fellow citizens. 



MARCELLUS L. JACKSOX. 

Marcellus L. Jackson, a representative business man of Hammonton. 
New Jersey, was born in Hartland, Maine. September 25, 1846. His parents. 
George P. and Elizabeth (Welch) Jackson, were both natives of Maine, the 
former of English and the latter of Irish ancestry. 

Mr. Jackson received a common-school and academic education in Hart- 
land. Maine, and for a year subsequent followed the vocation of teacher in 
his native state. Removing then to Burlington county. New Jersey, he con- 
tinued teaching there some three years longer, making in the meantime a 
brief tour through the west. In the spring of 187 1, removing to Hammon- 
ton, he engaged in business as a butcher, in company with Benjamin H. 
Bowles. This partnership continued for nearly three years, when Mr. Jack- 
son bought out the entire enterprise and has since continued business at the 
old location established in 1872. In 1895 he erected the present commodi- 
ous block, fifty by sixty-six feet, and two stories in height, in which he gives 
his entire attention to his market. In this building is also located the post- 
office, in apartments especially fitted up for the purpose by Mr. Jackson. 

Business success and prominence in the affairs of the town soon gave Mr. 
Jackson wide financial and civic influence. He was an original member and 
organizer of the Mechanics' Building & Loan Association and one of its di- 
rectors. He was also prominent in the organization of the \\"orkingmen"s 
Building & Loan Association, and was for some years its president and al- 
ways a director. One of the promoters of the Hammonton Bank, he was 
made its first vice-president, a position he still retains. 

An active Republican, he held the office of town clerk in 1879 and 1880. 
In 1885 he .was elected a freeholder, and still holds the office, without opposi- 
tion from either party, and for two years has been a director of the board. 
In 1895 ^I'"- Jackson was elected to the state legislature, by the largest vote 



CONGRESSIOX.JL DISTRICT OF XEIT JERSEY. 341 

ever cast for the office by his party, and in 1896 increased his former majority 
by about one thousand votes. In the legislature he has served on the com- 
mittee on agriculture and agricultural colleges; as the chairman of the build- 
ino- committee: on the committee on corporations and also as a member of 
the joint committee on the sinking fund. 

In 1899 Mr. Jackson was appointed the postmaster of Hammonton. He 
is a member of Winslow Lodge, No. 40, I. C). O. F.. and the treasurer of 
same; a member also of M. B. Taylor Lodge, No. 141. F. iS: A. M.. and a 
member of J. O. A. M. 

Mr. Jackson has been twice married. Ry his first wife, Adelaide, nee 
Burges, he had two sons, — Fred L.. deceased, and Albert L. By his second 
wife, Maggie, nee King, to whom he was married in May, 1882, he has also 
two children: Ernest M. and Edwin Leroy. His wife and eldest son are 
l)Oth earnest workers in theAIethodist Episcopal church. 



C. HOWARD W.VRD. 



C. Howard Ward, of Palatine, Xew Jersey, one of the industrious farmers 
of Salem county, was born on the farm where he now lives, January 24. 1861. 
He was educated at the common district schools, and early in life took up 
agriculture and stock-raising for a livelihood. He now has a large herd of 
registered cattle, — Jersey and Guernsey stock. He operates at the old family 
homestead, tending one hundred and fifty acres of land. Carrie Johnson, the 
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Johnson, of Upper Pittsgrove, became our 
subject's wife August 17. 1882. One son has Ijlessed this home circle. — 
William H. 

In political matters Mr. Ward is ever an active, aggressive man. attending 
all the conventions. He is a Republican, and was for si.x years one of the 
trustees of Salem county almshouse and acted as secretary of the board. He 
is a member of the Olivet Methodist church, belongs to the Order of Red 
Men and is the chief of records in his lodge, having held such position ever 
since the lodge was organized. He is also an honored member of the Inde- 
pendent Order of Odd Fellows. 

Concerning his parentage and ancestral connections, we may refer the 
reader to the biography of his brother, John C. Ward, in this volume. It 
should be stated, however, that his father was William H. Ward, a native of 
Woodbury, New Jersey. Our subject's mother was, before her marriage. 
Miss Mary Ann Cook, of Monmouth county. In our subject's innnediate 
family there were the following children: Joseph T.. John C, James C, 
Marv E., C. Howard, P'rank G. and one deceased.

-McKEXDREE L.WGLEY. 

iMcKendree Langiey. a resident farmer residing in Glassboro township, 
was born August 16, 1853, in this locality, and traces his ancestry back to 
Reuben Langiey. whose birth occurred in England, and who is the founder 
of the family in the New World. His son John was the grandfather of our 
subject, and the father was Samuel Langiey. who was born in Willow Grove. 
New Jersey, and removed to the farm. u])on which his son ^^IcKendree now 
resides, in 1845. He built the house in 185 1 and with characteristic energy 
began clearing and developing his land, placing five hundred acres under cul- 
tivation. He also did an extensive business in lumber and charcoal, and by 
his own efforts arose from a humble position to one of affluence. At the time 
of his death he was the owner of several hundred acres of valuable land in 
connection with other property and his possessions w ere a monument to his 
thrift and enterprise. He was not only a leading business man. Init was rec- 
ognized as one of the valued citizens of this community and served as the 
collector of his township when Clayton, Elk and Gloucester townships were 
one. A faithful member of the Methodist Episcopal church, he held all of 
its offices, labored earnestly for its upbuilding and died in its faith February 
4, 1890. His wife, who had the maiden name of Sophia Campbell, was a 
daughter of Da\id Campbell, of Cumberland county. New Jersey, a very 
prominent and influential citizen, who served as the judge of the county

McKendree Langiey pursued his education in the common schools, which 
he attended through the winter season, while in the summer months he 
worked upon the home farm. He early began to follow the plow and to aid 
in harvesting the crops, and thus gained a practical knowledge of the business 
to which he now dc.otes his energies. He owns seventv-five acres of rich

and arable land and is engaged in general farming, his well tilled fields yield- 
ing him a golden tribute in return for the care and labor bestowed upon them. 
On the i6th of August. 1881. Mr. Langley was united in marriage to 
:Miss Ida, a daughter of Uriah Turpin. of W'illiamstown, New Jersey. Seven

Methodist Episcopal church, and the family is one widely and favorably 
known in the community. 



ASA GARDINER. 



Asa Gardiner is living a retired life at his pleasant home near Pitman 
Grove. For many years he carried on agricultural pursuits in Gloucester 
county, and having acquired a comfortable competency he was at length en- 
abled "to lay aside the more arduous cares of business life, his former talents 
having provided him with the means that supplies him with all the necessi- 
ties, and many of the luxuries, that go to make existence pleasurable. 

Mr. Gardiner was born December 28. 1823. on a farm two miles from 
Mullica Hill. His grandfather was James Gardiner and his father was 
Amos Gardiner. The latter was Iwrn near the Black Horse Tavern in the 
vicinity of Mullica Hill, and became a successful farmer of that section of the 
county. He also engaged in school-teaching and served his township as a 
school trustee, taking an active interest in the cause of education, largely pro- 
moting the interests of the schools in his neighborhood. He held member- 
ship in the Society of Friends and lived an upright and honorable life worthy 
of the confidence and esteem of all. His death occurred about 1884, and his 
wife passed away in 1867. She bore the maiden name of Anna Daniels, and 
was a daughter of John Daniels. By her marriage she became the mother of 
nine children, four of whom are living, as follows: Maria, the wife of Gideon 
Turner, of Swedesboro. Gloucester county; Asa; Amos, who is living in 
Mullica Hill; and George, a resident of Westville. New Jersey. 

Asa Gardiner pursued his education in the common schools and at an 
early age began to assist in the development and cultivation of the home 
farm. In 1844 he began farming on his own account near Jefifersonville, 
where he remained one year, after which he removed to a place between 
Barnsboro and Pitman Grove, where he carried on agricultural pursuits 
through the long period of forty years. His practical and progressive meth- 
ods were attended with a gratifying degree of success and he gained a hand- 
some competence which now enaliles him to live retired. He at one tune 



344 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

owned the land which is now included within Alcyon park, a pleasure resort 
near Pitman Grove. He is still the owner of a valuable tract of one hundred 
and forty acres, which yields to him a good income. 

Mr. Gardiner has been twice married. First he wedded Louisa, the 
daughter of Ely Heritage, who died in 1859. Their only child is also de- 
ceased. For his second wife he chose Keziah Eastlock. a daughter of James 
Eastlock, of Mantua. She is still living and has three children: Sarah, the 
wife of Edward Justice, of Penn Grove; Anna, the wife of Samuel L. Justice, 
also of Penn Grove; and Kate, the wife of Josiah Shute, of Pitman Grove. 

Mr. Gardiner takes a deep interest in everything pertaining to the welfare 
of the community and has ef^ciently served as a school trustee. His life has 
been an active and useful one, devoted to honorable business pursuits and 
to the faithful performance of his duties of citizenship. This has made his 
record a commendable one, worthy of a place in the history of his native 
county. 



WILLL\M K. WILLL\MSON. 

Ocean City has no more acti\-e champion than this gentleman, whose deep 
interest in its welfare is manifested in his well directed efforts for its improve- 
ment and upbuilding. He was born in Bloomfield, Essex county. New Jersey, 
September 4, 1848, and is a son of William J. and Amies (Keene) \Mlliam- 
son. The name is of Scotch origin and the first progenitor of the family in 
America was William Williamson, who left the land of his nativity to seek a 
home beyond the broad Atlantic. The grandfather of our subject also bore 
the name of William, and was born in what was then Belle\ille, Xew Jersey, 
a little town which now forms a part of the city of Newark. He engaged in 
quarrying sandstone for building purposes, was also one of the extensive 
farmers in Bloomfield; and the family homestead which he occupied had 
been in possession of his ancestors for nearl_\- two hundred _\ears. and is yet 
owned by his descendants. He was an honored country gentleman who con- 
trolled extensive property interests and by his upright life commanded the 
respect of his fellow men. He served his country in the war of 18 12. His 
W'ife bore the maiden name of Margaret Bowman, and their children were 
Margaret; Eliza; Adeline; Mrs. Maria Bowman; William J.; and Jane, wife 
of Thomas Munn, of Orange, New Jersey. All died within six years, the 
youngest one being seventy-nine years of age at the time of his death, while 
the eldest was eighty-eight. The family has ever been noted for longevity, 
although the grandfather died at the age of forty-four years; his wife, how- 
ever, reached the advanced age of eighty-nine years.

William J. Williamson was Ijorn in Bloonilield, New Jersey, in icSi2. and 
was educated in the public schools of Newark and in Seymour Academy. He 
was a country gentleman whose real-estate interests were extensive and who 
added to his property by fortunate speculations. Through his efforts the 
agricultural interests of this community were largely promoted. He owned 
a large farm near Newark and did much to improve the grade of stock raised 
in that section of the state. He served as a member of the city council and 
of the school board, and was a very active member and worker in the First 
Presbyterian church, in which he served as a deacon and a trustee. In his 
family were two sons and two daughters: William K., Margaret, Lill\ and 
Ellis N. Tlie last named is connected with the Evening Post of New York 
city and resides in Bloomfield, New Jersey. The father of this family was 
called to his final rest in June, 1896, at the age of seventy-nine years, and the 
mother passed away in February, 1898, at the age of seventy-eight years. 

William K. Williamson, having acquired his education in the common 
schools, became a student in Bloomfield Academy and later matriculated in 
Columbia College, where on the completion of the classical course he was 
graduated in 1871. Two years later he was graduated in the Columbia Law 
School, previous to which time he had read law under the direction of Court- 
land Parker, a distinguished legist of Newark, New Jersey. From his ofifice 
he was admitted to practice in May, 1873, and for two years was a member 
of the bar of Newark. During that time he acted as the counsel of Bloom- 
field township, and served as a member of the city board of aldermen. Later 
he became connected with journalistic interests in Wilmington, Delaware, as 
the city editor of the Morning News, in which capacity he served for five 
years. He then became connected with the theatrical business, as the man- 
ager of theaters in Wilmington, Delaware: Lancaster, Pennsylvania: Albany, 
New York; and in Trenton, New Jersey. He had several companies uiion 
the road and traveled through every state and territory in the LTnion. On 
severing his connection with the stage in 1896 he came to Ocean City, where 
he had previously made extensive investments in real estate and where he 
liad spent his summers for some years previously. He has taken an active 
and important part in the upbuilding of the tow-n and has valuable property 
interests here and in Bloomfield, New Jersey. He does all in his power to 
]jromote the improvement of Ocean City and withholds his support from no 
movement or measure which he believes will be a public benefit. 

On the I2th of March. 1881, Mr. Williamson was united in marriage to 
Miss Roberta M. Stanley, of South Carolina, and they now have one of the 
most beautiful and attractive homes in Ocean City, occupying one of the fine 
building sites here. ^Ir. W'illiamson is a member of the IMasonic fraternity.

GAINER P. MOORE. 



The history of the community is best told in the lives of its representative 
citizens, for it is to the business and executive ability of the prominent men 
of the town to which is attributed its progress along all lines of intel- 
lectual, moral and material advancement. No city, no matter how great 
her natural resources, ever rose to any degree of prosperity that did not o\\ e 
credit of her possessions to the men within her limits and their ability to de- 
velop these resources and create new enterprises. To those who have faith 
in her future and contribute toward her prosperity by investing capital and 
identifying themselves in e\ery ])ossil)le manner with her interests, the ques- 
tion of failure is not only improbable but impossible. That Mr. Moore has 
ever believed in the future of Ocean City is demonstrated by the fact that he 
has been the promoter of many of its leading interests, and its growth is 
largely due to the wise effort which he put forth during his service of twelve 
years in the mayoralty. 

He claims Pennsylvania as the state of his nativity, his l.iirth having oc- 
curred in Chester county, on the 13th of June, 1836. He is a representative 
of two old families connected with the Society of Friends, and is a son of 
William and Lydia (Moore) Moore. His father was born July 12, 1779, in 
Chester county. He was a carpenter and cooper by trade, and spent his en- 
tire life in the counties of Chester and Lancaster. During the war of 181 2 
he was drafted for service, but paid the redemption fee and remained with his 
family. His religious belief was in harmony with the doctrines of the Society 
of Friends, and his political faith was with the Whig party. He married 
Lydia Moore, and to them were born eight children, namely: George,

Mr. Moore, of this review, acquired his education in the public schools of 
Chester county, and worked with his father until nineteen years of age. He 
learned the carpenter's trade at Atglen, and also followed it to some extent 
in Calhoun county, Michigan. During the civil war he offered his services 
to the government, but failed to pass the physical examination, being re-

jected on account of a slight lameness. When Lee's army invaded Pennsyl- 
vania he offered his services a second time, was accepted, and went with four 
companies of the state militia to guard the fort at Peach Bottom on the Sus- 
quehanna river. In 1866 he embarked in merchandising at Atglen, Chester 
county where he remained for seven years and later resumed work at the 
carpenter's trade, and on the 14th of April, 1881. came to Ocean City, where 
he has since engaged in'business as an architect, contractor and budder. He 
erected a number of the first houses in the place, and has since put up many 
cottages and fine residences. He is not only an expert builder, but is an 
architect as well, and therefore many of the homes in this place stand as 
monuments to his skill and enterprise. He furnishes employment to a large 
force of workmen, sometimes as many as twenty-five, and has received a lib- 
eral patronage. He is also engaged in the real-estate business, handling 
some valuable property, and is the proprietor of greenhouses at this place. 

Mr. Moore was elected the first mayor of Ocean City, and seven times 
has been chosen to that position. During his services many important 
municipal improvements have been made, and at all times he has exercised 
his official prerogative to advance the welfare of the city. Upon him and 
the council fell the arduous labor of creating and establishing a borough gov- 
ernment on the foundation of temperance, and he has always added his co- 
operation to such projects as have given promise of success and which con- 
tribute to the advancement of the interests of Ocean City in point of wealth, 
population and intelligence. During his service as mayor the first railroad 
was completed to Ocean City. It was a spur of the West Jersey & Sea- 
shore line, extending from Sea Isle Junction to this place, a distance of seven- 
teen miles. He granted the franchise for the erection of the first trolley rail- 
road, and while he occupied the office of mayor he gave his aid and influence 
for the establishment of the water-works, the electric-light plant and the 
sewer system. Under his administration much street grading was done, 
and two board walks were built along the ocean shore. He also established 
the fire department, and at the present time he is serving as a member of the 
board of education, having for nine years been the district clerk of the board. 
The public schools find in him a warm friend, whose interests are largely 
advanced through his efforts. He is now a justice of the peace, notary pul)- 
lic and commissioner of deeds. 

On the 3d of February .\i863. :Mr. Moore was united in marriage to Har- 
riet E. Bufifington, and four children have been born to them, — Eva, a teacher 
in the kindergarten school in New York city; Ellis H.. a painter of Ocean 
Citv: Morris H.. an electrician, who married Lizzie Kates, and has two 
daughters. Etta and Ruth: and ^^lary. who has successfully engaged in teach-

sity of Pennsyh'ania. The family attend the Methodist Episcopal church, of 
which Mr. Moore is a faithful member and officer, serving on the official 
board at the present time. Socially he is connected with the Junior Order of 
American Mechanics and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. .\ con- 
temporary biographer has said of him: '"Adhering- tenaciouslx' to his con- 
victions of what is just and right, his popularity has been honorably achie\ed. 
and is but the logical outcome of conscientious direction of unborn capabili- 
ties to wise results." 



RICHARD T. S:\HTH. 



Richard Thompson Smith, of Salem, is one of the enterprising and sub- 
stantial farmers wiio have done much to promote the w-elfare of the county. 
He is a son of Powell and Sarah Elizabeth (Elpinton) Smith and was born in 
Mannington township, this count}-. November 26. 1850. His grandfather. 
Isaac Smith, and great-grandfather. Powell Smith, were also residents of this 
township and carried on farming, the latter owning one hundred and seventy 
acres of land, which he culti\'ated. He was a Democrat and a member of the 
Society of Friends. Two ciiildren were born to him: Sallie. Mrs. Wood- 
side; and Isaac Smith. The latter continued to conduct farming operations 
in his native tow-nship and laid up a neat competency, which enabled him to 
retire from the arduous duties of farm life some fifteen years prior to his 
death and take up his residence in Salem. Like his father, he was a Demo- 
crat and belonged to the Society of Friends of the Salem meeting. He was 
married to Margaret Earnest, who bore him se\en children. \iz.: Powell.

Collier, an insurance man of Philadelphia; and Josiah. who is a poultry dealer 
of Salem and w-ho married Catherine Lawrence and has three children. — • 
Hannah. Sallie, and Arthur. The grandfather died in 1869, at the age of 
sixty-nine years, while the grandmother reached' the age of seventy-six or 
seventy-seven. 

Powell Smith was the eldest of his father's famil\- and grew to manhood 
in his native township. Generations of the family had been wedded to the 
occupation of farming and he also turned his attention to that pursuit. He 



CONGRESSIOA'AL DISTRICT OP XEIl' JERSFA'. 349 

was a Democrat and a memljer of the Friends' meeting at Salem. He was 
twice married, his first wife, Sarah Elizabeth Elpinton, being the mother of 
six children, of whom our subject is the eldest. They are Richard T. ; Sallie, 
who married Albert Risnier, a farmer; Isaac, deceased; Annie, who married 
David Jones, a farmer, and has two children,— Henry and Sallie; Mary, who 
died young; and Powell, who died in infancy. The mother died in 1867, at 
the age of thirty-nine years. The second marriage, to Rebecca (Keene) 
Dowling, was without issue. The father is now in his seventy-third year and 
is a well preserved gentleman. 

Richard Thompson Smith attended the pay schools of Salem until he 
reached his eighteenth year, when he left school to attend the duties on the 
farm. He remained with his father until he was twenty-seven years of age. 
when he began farming for himself, first ui his native township and later in 
Lower PeniVs Neck. He continued this work until 1881, when he moved 
to Salem and abandoned farming to try the butcher business. After devot- 
ing a short time to this enterprise he once more took up farming, in Lower 
Penn's Neck township, where he has a fine farm of one hundred and forty- 
eight acres, besides other business interests. 

He was married in 1876 to Martha Patterson, who was a daughter of 
Martin Patterson, of Lower Penn's Neck township. She died Septeml^er 8, 
1877, and in June. 1881, he was wedded to his present wife, Amanda Fox, a 
daughter of Jacob and Lucy Ann Fox, a farmer of Lower Penn's Neck town- 
ship. Two children have blessed their union,— Powell and Lucy, — both at 
home. Mr. Smith has twice represented the west ward of the city on the 
Democratic ticket and has always worked for the public interest. He is one 
of the strongest advocates of the much discussed filter for the city, and pushes 
any enterprise that will help the general public. He was for three years a 
member of the township committee and is respected by all regardless of party. 



SAMUEL G. LEFEVRE. 

Samuel G. Lefevre, who resides in Pitman Grove, and is engaged in busi- 
ness in the Terminal Market. Philadelphia, was born in Lancaster county, 
Pennsylvania, on the 15th of September, 1850. His father, Henry \\'. Le-

entering the service of that company at the time Tom Scott became one of its 
employes. Lt 1894, when his death occurred, Mr. Lefevre was the oldest

sixteen he left school and began the life of a sailor. He hrst sailed on a 
vessel that did a coast trade and then went upon the high seas, soon becom- 
ing an experienced sailor and rising to the position of captain of a vessel. 
He commanded the ship that carried the first cargo of cotton from Xew 
Orleans to Havre, France, after the civil war and before he was in the employ 
of the civil government, and had some hairbreadth escapes and thrilling ex- 
periences. He carried coal to supply Farragut's fleet before it entered Mobile 
bay. Only a few hours after he had coaled a certain vessel it was sunk on 
Mobile bar by a torpedo. While at sea Mr. Applegit's home was at Brook- 
lyn, New Yoi-k. In 1868 he retired from the sea to his old home at Bridge- 
ton, and since 1888 he has lived on a farm in Salem county; but the memories 
of those old days on the sea are a source of much pleasure to both himself 
and friends, who never tire of hearing him recall them. 

August 16, 1853, Mr. Applegit was united in the holy bonds of matrimony 
to Miss Mary V. Coombs, a sister of Henry Coombs, who is represented in 
thise biographical work. Captain Applegit and his wife took up their resi- 
dence on the farm where they now reside in 1888. It contains two hundred 
and eighty-one acres of fine land, and in addition he owns fifty-three acres 
within the' city limits of Bridgeton. As a farmer he has been very successful 
and has laid up a considerable competency to take him through life's evening 
hours with comfort and ease. 



MISS CAROLINE G. WEBB. 

This lady is the fortunate owner of a beautiful country home in Williams- 
town, Gloucester county, where she passes about half of each year. Here 
she is surrounded with numerous evidences of a refined taste, and the hours 
speed all too sw'iftly by, for she is a great lover of nature and takes delight in 
rambling about this beautiful region. She is well and favorably known to 
the local inhabitants, and many a deed of timely assistance and loving sym- 
pathy shown towards those in sickness or trouble is justly laid at her door. 
During the winter season she makes her home in Philadelphia, where the 
o-reater part of her life has been spent, but she has a special fondness for her 
pleasant residence in ^^"illiamstown. 

Aliss Webb is the onlv survivor of a family which originally comprised 
eight members, — Thomas W. and Susanna (Douglass) Webb, and their six 
children. Her paternal ancestors were natives of England, and her grand- 
father, William Webb, was born in Maryland, and became a wealthy planter, 
ownino- a number of farms and slaves, and a store at Denton, ^Maryland. He

was a man of influence in his connnunity. everyone looking to him for advice 
and counsel. 

Thomas \\'. Webb, who was born near Denton, on the old plantation. 
April lo. 1808. received special instruction from a private tutor, as the pub- 
lic schools of that early day and locality were few and poorly conducted. In 
1824 he removed to Philadelphia on account of his poor health, and later he 
learned the druggist's business, following that calling until his death. He 
was veni- successful and enterprising, investing large sums of money in Phil- 
adelphia real estate from time to time, laying out an addition to the city, and 
in various ways finally amassed a fortune. His integrity and justice were 
beyond question, and, though he was keen-sighted and judicious in business 
affairs, he scorned anything like over-reaching, and his word was considered 
as good as his bond. He was well read, keeping thoroughly posted on the 
leading topics of the day. and at all times he was ready to do all within his 
power for the promotion of the welfare of the public. He was summoned to 
his reward on the 13th of January, 1877, loved and mourned by all who had 
had the pleasure of his acquaintance. His widow, who was a daughter of 
John Douglass, survived him a number of years, her death occurring in 1893. 
Her family were very prominent in Philadelphia, and were descendants of 
natives of Scotland. — Friends, who came over to America with William 
Penn. 

Randolph Webb, a son of Thomas W". and Susanna W'ebb, was born June 
I, 1847, in the Quaker City, where he obtained an excellent education. Dur- 
ing the progress of the civil war his health failed, and it wa| decided that an 
out-door life might prove of benefit to him. Accordingly, he removed to 
W'illiamstown. in 1863, and thenceforth gave his attention to the manage- 
ment of a fine homestead which he purchased. This valuable farm, one of 
the best in this locality, comprises about five hundred acres, well improved 
and suited to the raising of a varied line of crops. For a wife, Air. W'el^b 
chose Miss Ida C. Atkinson, a daughter of Edwin F. Atkinson, of Franklin- 
ville. and one child was born to their union. Mabel R., now a resident of 
Philadelphia. Mr. Webb, whose health was never of the strongest, lived to 
enjov his pleasant home here for several years, but while still in the prime of 
earlv manhood he was called upon to lay down the burdens of life and to 
enter into the heavenly rest. Though more than a decade has rolled away 
since he left these earthly scenes, his demise having occurred February i, 
1879, his memory is fresh and tenderly cherished in the hearts of his innumer- 
able friends. Like his father before him, he was of a kindly, sympathetic dis- 
position, and won the respect of his acquaintances by a thousand quiet, 
unassuming deeds of thoughtfulness and love.

three sons, — ^^'illiam M.. Samuel E., and Joseph, — the last mentioned a resi- 
dent of ^'ineland. The father died in 1877 and the mother was spared but a 
few short months, until the 28th of the following June, when she. too. was 
laid to rest. 

William M. Tombleson was educated in the public schools and began the 
task of a wage-earner at an early age. He worked at various pursuits, — 
farming, teaming, and lumbering for several years — and has always been re- 
garded as one of the wide-awake, hustling men of this county. In 1897 he 
purchased a small farm of twenty-five acres, where he resides, and which is 
devoted to general farming. He is a Democrat in politics and has been the 
efticient road overseer of this township for seven years past, and in 1892 was

cultural interests of Gloucester county. He resides at Cross Keys, and was 
horn on the farm which he still makes his home, on the 28th of June, 1855.

child blessed this union, named Hansford G. Mr. Collins holds membership 
in the Methodist Episcopal church, and also belongs to the Grange. He is 
widely and favorably known in the community where he has always made his 
home and has a large circle of warm friends here. 



JOHN W. THO:\lPSON. 



This gentleman is a prominent representative of the business and political 
interests of Cape May. and possesses that force of character and individual 
worth that well fits him for leadership in any walk of life. Marked enter- 
prise and executive ability have gained him a prominent place in business 
circles, and in official positions he has displayed keen discrimination, com- 
bined with fidelity to duty. 

John West Thompson was born June 17. 1857. in the city of Cape May. 
a son of Richard R. and Anna S. (Hand) Thompson. He attended the pub- 
lic schools in his native town until eighteen years of age. and then worked 
for eighteen years at the printer's trade. For one year he had charge of the 
publication of the \'inelan(l Independent, and at different times has worked 
in Philadelphia in the office of Spangler & Davis, job printers, also in the of- 
fices of C. S. McGrath. of the Cape May Wave, and on the Cape May Star. 
Called to public office, he put aside his journalistic duties and has filled vari- 
ous positions of public trust. From 1893 mil^il 1897 he served as the post- 
master of Cape May, during President Cleveland's second administration, 
and in 1898 was elected city recorder, in which office he is now serving. He 
was appointed by the city council superintendent of the waterworks, city 
clerk and recorder of l)onds. He has ever discharged his duties in a prompt 
and able manner, fully meeting the pulilic confidence and trust. He has 
served as delegate to several senatorial and state conventions, and at all times- 
takes a deep and active interest in his ]5arty, doing all in his ])o\\er to ])ro- 
mote the growth and insure the success of the Democracw 

^^'ith one of the leading business interests of the city Mr. Thompson is 
also connected, being president of the Cape May Transportation Company, 
which was organized in 1896 and is the successor of the Cape May 8z Dela-

trolley road, extending from Sewell's Point to Cape May Point, a distance of 
eight miles, and carrying half a million ])eople annually. Under the presi- 
dency of Mr. Thompson this is proving a profitable investment, yielding a 
good return to the stockholders. He is also a member of the boarrl of trade 
and of the Cape May Building & Loan Association. 

In March, 1892, Mr. Thompson married Miss Mar\, daughter of Enoch 
and Louise B. (Shaw) Schillinger, and to them have been born three chil- 
dren: Louisa, Fannie and Marie. Mr. Thompson is a member of Cape 
Island Lodge, No. 30, F. & A. M., the Cape May I^elief Association, the 
Improved Order of Heptasophs and the Masonic Relief Association, and at- 
tends the First Presbyterian church. His is a well rounded character, sym- 
metrically developed because the interests to which he has given his time 
and attention have been varied, .\ttention concentrated on one thing alone 
brings an uneven development, but our subject is one whose sympathies are 
broad and whose interest in social, religious, political and material enter- 
prises have been manifest in his active co-operation therewith. In business 
he carries forward to successful completion whatever he undertakes and is 
therefore one of the prosperous citizens of Cape May. 



ROBERT S. FOGG. 



Among the most important industries of southern New Jersey are the 
many canning factories, situated throughout Salem and Cumberland coun- 
ties, which furnish employment to hunflreds of men, women and children 
and a market to the farmers who raise acre upon acre of tomatoes each year 
to keep the factories running. No name has been more closely identified 
with the canning industry than that of Robert S. Fogg, who, in conjunction 
with Lucius E. Flires, owns and conducts three of the most successful plants 
in operation in the state and is one of the best known and most respectefl 
residents of Salem. 

The family were originally from luTgland. although several generations of 
them have made their home in this county and have figurerl among the promi- 
nent and substantial residents. His immediate ancestors are Aaron A. and 
Mary (Sheppard) Fogg, to whom he was born in this county on July 3, 1847. 
The great-grandfather, .\aron Fogg, was a farmer of Lower Alloway Creek 
township and a member of the Society of Friends. He married Hannah .Mien 
and reared a family of eight children, namely: Elisha, David, Rebecca. 
Ebenezer, Sarah, .\aron, Thomas and Samuel. Da\-id Fogg, the grandfather.

in earl}- life (le\-oted his energies to luishandry on tlie old homestead in. Allo- 
way Creek townshij). He afterward mo\'ed to Mannington. townshii.i and 
later to Elsinhoro, where he resided at the time of his death. He met with 
considerahle success in his chosen occupation. He was a Reimhlican in 
politics and a member of the Society of Friends. He married Hannah Hil- 
dreth, daughter of Jonathan Hildreth. of Allowax' Creek township. Salem 
county. The fruits of this union were Lydia, who married Jonathan Grier, 
Joseph, Aaron, David .\. and Hannali and Joanna, who were twins. David 
Fogg was permitted to spend a long life of usefulness before he was called to 
his reward, in the year 1874, aged eighty-five \-ears. His \-enerali!e wife 
almost rounded out the century of her life, li\-ing to the extreme age of 
ninety-two years. 

Aaron A. Fogg was born [March 14, 1820, in .Mlowax- Creek township, 
and at the age of twenty-two \'ears located on a farm in Mannington town- 
ship and became a prosperous farmer of that section. In 1871 he moved to 
Salem, where he lived a retired life during his remaining years. He died at 
the age of seventy-nine. He belonged to the Society of Friends and was a 
consistent Christian man. He married Mary Sheppard, who bore him eight 
children: Jonathan H., who is a farmer of Alannington township and mar- 
ried Elizabeth \\'addington: ]\Iary Emma, who married Casper \\'istar. for- 
merly a farmer but since 1876 a resident of Philadelphia; Robert S., our 
subject: Aar(jn, who died in infancy: Aima F., a resident of Salem: Haimah 
J., who died at the age of twenty-eight vears: David S., who married Carrie 
M. Thompson and is a farmer of Mannington township: and Charles M.. who 
is associated with the Kex'Stone Watch Company, of Fhiladelphia. The 
mother of these children is still li\'ing, a widow, now in her sevent\"-eighth 
year. 

Robert S. Fogg was educated at the Salem Friends" School and Salem 
Academy and then went on the homestead farm in Mannington township, 
where he lived until 1884. He was a methodical worker and met with un- 
qualified success in the fields of agriculture, where he was recognized as a 
leader. In 1884 he engaged in the canning industry at Quinton, with Lucius 
E. Hires as a partner, under the firm name of Fogg & Hires, anil at once 
built up a large trade in their superior brands of canned tomatoes. The 
firm was changed to Fogg & Hires Company in 1895. -'^'t' t'^^ business has 
increased until it now requires three factories to supply the demand for their 
goods. The factory at Quinton employs two hundred and tifty hands during

as stenographer to Mr. S. Garwood, who was the superintendent of the rail- 
road company. He also did work for the glass works. He has been vari- 
ously employed by the glass company and is now superintendent of the com- 
pany's store. 

in politics. Mr. \\'ea\er is a Republican, and none takes a liyelier interest 
in his party's success than does he. He was member of the school board for 
four years. He is a member of the Methodist church and has served as one 
of its stewards for seven years. For several years he has taught the 
young men's Bible class, besides having led the choir ten years. He was one 
of the seven charter members who instituted the Masonic lodge at \\ illiams- 
town. and was one of its first officials. Looking toward the protection of his 
family, he is a member of the A. O. U. W. and Junior Order of American 
Mechanics. It should here be added that our subject is the present secre- 
tan,- of the Bodine Glass Company. In a recent conversation with him it 
was learned that he thinks the world is doing all for him that he desenes— 
he is satisfied and never given to grumbling. 

Like most truly sensible men. our subject is a married man! It was Oc- 
tober 16. 1883. when he married Sabina E. Spangler. the daughter of Mn 
and Mrs. Moses Spangler. of Berks. Pennsylvania. They are the parents of 
five children, four of whom are living: Elmer S.. Elizabeth R.. Helen E. 
and John H. 

AUGUSTUS THIES. 

The life record of this gentleman proves that success may be attained by 
well directed effort even when fate has vouchsafed no assistance in the way 
of wealth. He is now numbered among the substantial citizens of the com- 
munity- and has arisen to this position by diligence and perseverance. He 
owns and occupies a valuable farm of one hundred and sixty acres near Hurff- 
ville. Gloucester county, and the neat and thrifty appearance of his place well 
indicates his careful supervision. 

Mr. Thies is a representative of the Teutonic race, his birth having oc- 
curred in Bremen. Germany. November 6. 1839. His father. Henry, was 
also a native of that locality and carried the mail between Bremen and Han- 
over, in the early days before the era of railroad transportation. He also 
drove the stage between those points and carried Prince Albert when he 
went to England to marn,- Queen \'ictoria. He always spoke of the prince 
as one of the most pleasant young men he had ever seen. In 1844 he deter- 
mined to trv- his fortune in America, and bidding adieu to friends and native

land he sailed for the New World, taking up his abode in Long Island. Sub- 
sequently he went to Philadelphia, and in 1849 came to Camden near Mexico. 
There he engaged in farming and through that occupation supported his 
family. In his religious ijelief he was a Presbyterian. His death occurred 
in 1865, and his wife passed away in 1868. They were the parents of five 
children, two of whom are yet living, namely: Harriet, the wife of Charles 
Ganglebrough, of Philadelphia; and Augustus, of this review. 

The latter attended the common schools of this country, being only five 
years of age at the time of the emigration of his parents to America. He 
was a student of Bunker Hill school in 1849 ^"d acquired a fair English edu- 
cation, which well fitted him for the practical duties of life. In 1863 he pur- 
chased the farm upon which he now resides, a tract of one hundred and sixty- 
five acres. This was covered with timber, which he cleared away, hauling 
the wood to Philadelphia, where it was used for fuel. As acre after acre was 
placed under the plow the rich fields yielded to him a golden tribute in return 
for the care and labor he bestowed upon them and to-day he is the owner of 
a very valuable and productive farm. He carries on general farming and 
market gardening, raising vegetables for the city market. 

As a companion and helpmeet in life Mr. Thies chose Miss Mary Ann 
Hann, the daughter of Joseph Hann, also of Bunker Hill, Gloucester county, 
their marriage taking place in 1865. Unto them have been born nine chil- 
dren, se\'en of whom are living, as follows: Henry, who resides near his 
father; Augustus, who makes his home at Bunker Hill; Harriet, Charles, 
Mary Ann, Clarence and William, all at home. The family is well and favor- 
ably known in this locality and highly esteemed for sterling worth. 

Mr. Thies gives his political support to the Democracy and his fellow 
townsmen appreciate his worth and ability, having frequently called him to 
public office. He has served in a number of the township positions and for 
three terms has been a freeholder of Gloucester county. At all times he has 
been actively interested in everything pertaining to the intellectual, material 
and moral progress of the community.

He has also been a trustee and steward in the church, ami is a most earnest 
worker in its behalf. He is also a member of the Junior Order of American 
Mechanics. 



DAMD B. WADDINGTOX. 

David Bowen Waddington owns and conducts one of the best meat mar- 
kets in this part of the state, at 160 Broadway, Salem. He is also a farmer 
of ability and prominence and enjoys the distinction of being strictly up-to- 
date in his methods. He was born April 4, 1844, in Elsinlx)ro township, 
Salem county, to Richard and Mary Ann (Bowen) Waddington. 

Richard \\'addington. his father, was also born in this county, in Octolser, 
181 1, and was educated in the district schools. \\"hen he reaclietl manhood 
he engaged in the mercantile business for one year at Hancock's Bridge. 
Later he purchased a farm in Elsinl^oro township, where he spent the balance 
of his life in the quiet pursuit incident to country life. He acquired con- 
siderable property and at his death was the owner of three farms aggregating 
three hundred and fifty acres. One farm is situated in Alloway Creek town- 
ship, while two are located in Elsinboro, and represent in a measure his suc- 
cessful business methods. Eight years before his death, which occurred in 
his eighty-third year, he retired to Salem, where the sunset years of his life 
were passed in a quiet and restful manner, an end well befitting his long life 
of activity. He was a strong adherent of the Society of Friends and a Demo- 
crat in his political views, yet he was ever tolerant of the views of others and 
did not endeavor to force his opinions on them. He was in high repute and 
was chosen to fill a number of local offices, where his kindly nature manifested 
itself in the interest of those with whom he had dealings. He was twice 
married, his first wife being Mary Ann Bowen, the mother of our subject. 
The other children were Edward, who was bom March 27,. 1839, and mar- 
ried ]Mary Hood: Anna, who was born in August, 1840, and married \\'illiam 
Ware, a retired farmer of Salem, by whom she had two children, — Minna 
and Richard; Lizzie, the deceased wife of Jonathan Fogg, a farmer, by whom 
she had si.x children, — 'Mary, Elmer, Roland, Hannah, Bessie and Lla:

and^has two children.— Edward and Man.-. The mother of our subject died 
in her fortv-seventh year. 

David B. Waddington attended the Friends' school at Salem until he 
was twenty rears of age and then assisted his father with the farm work 
until his m'arriage. when he began farming for himself in Quinton township. 
He remained in that locality for seven years, when he purchased a farm ot 
one hundred and forty-three acres in Piles Grove township, which he culti- 
vated for seventeen vears. at the same time making it his home. At that time 
he came to Salem and bought his fine residence on Oak street and engaged 
in the meat business. Much credit is due him for furnishing the citizens of 
Salem with meat of choice variety and the best possible grade. In order to 
do thi^ he buvs large herds of cattle and ships them to his farms, where they 
are fattened and made readv for slaughter. The butchering is done on the 
farm and great pains is taken to have the meat in the best possible shape 
when it i^ -^ent to his market, where three men are constantly employed to 
. look after the wants of his patrons. He frequently has as many as one hun- 
dred head of cattle on his place, as he keeps about forty cows and often fat- 
tens sixty steers at a time. That his market is a favorite buying place with 
the re«;idents is shown bv the lucrative and extended trade which he enjoys. 
He is assisted in this work by his son. and the slaughtering is done weekly. 
He still maintains a strict surveillance of his farms, of which he owns two. 
one at Piles Grove and the old homestead farm of one hundred and twenty 
acres in Elsinboro township, and raises principally hay and grass, much of 
which is fed to his stock, of which he also raises large herds. 

He is a Democrat and firm in support of his convictions.— a right which 
he freeh accords to all. His life has been too fully occupied with his busi- 
ness to admit of political intrigues, even had his aspirations been in that 
direction. He was married March 8. 1871. to Margaret Stretch, of Qouces- 
ter county, this state. Three children have blessed their union: Lucie, who 
married Richard Layton. a farmer on the Piles Grove farm, and has two 
children, .\lice and R. Kirby: Richard, who married Mar> Atkinson, is a 
farmer on the Elsinboro farm and has one child. ]^Iargaret: and Fannie, who 
diea at the age of eight months. Mrs. Waddington departed this life Sep- 
tember 17. 1897. at the age of fiftj-eight years, and her death was deen\v 
deplored by a wide circle who knew and appreciated her worth.

REUBEX W. RYAN. 

It is the glory of our American republic that the field of o])portunity 
is not limited, that indi\iduality finds scope for development and that enter- 
prise may rise above environment and overthrow the obstacles that block 
the path to success. The majority of men who are to-day the leaders in the 
commercial and professional life of thriving communities are those who 
have risen by their own unaided eflforts, and of this class ^Ir. Ryan is a repre- 
sentative. At the age of fourteen he started out upon an independent busi- 
ness career, securing a humble clerkship, and to-day he occupies a prominent 
position in commercial circles, being the ])roprietor of one of the finest gen- 
eral stores on the Atlantic coast. 

-A. native of Pennsylvania, he was born near Churclnille. Bucks c(^unt}'. 
that state, February 12. 1864, his jjarents lieing Edward if. and Florence 
L. (Koons) Ryan. His paternal grandfather, William R_\-an, resided near 
Churchville and follow ed the occupation of farming, owning a large 
tract of land in that localit^•. He also engaged in hauling produce from his 
neighborhood to the city of Philadelphia, on commission. Prior to the war 
he gave his political support to the Democracy, but after the south attempted 
to overthrow the Union he stood 1)y the party that was the main defense of* 
the stars and stripes and stanchly advocated Republican principles until his 
death. In his religious faith he was a Presbyterian. He married Elizabeth 
Van Horn, a member of the Society of Friends, and they became the parents 
of three children: Alarv Ellen, wife of ^\'illiam Levis; Edward H.: and 
Hannah, the wife of Jesse Hart. Both the grandfather and the grandmother 
of our subject died when seventy-six years of age. 

Edward H. Ryan was born in a log cabin in Bucks county, Peiuisylvania, 
December 18, 1832, and was educated in the common schools. In early life 
he engaged in farming and in the commission lousiness, and later was the 
proprietor of a flour and feed store in Philadelphia, where he carried on 
operations at the corner of Frankford road and Adams street until 1891. 
He married Miss Florence L. Koons, and they have two children, — Reuben 
W. and Delia. — the latter the wife of \^'illiam S. Mellon, a china decorator 
residing in Philadelphia. In his political views Mr. Ryan is a stanch Repub- 
lican and served on a number of committees, doing all in his power to pro- 
mote the growth and insure the success of his party. During the civil war 
he enlisted for the service, but hostilities ceased before he was sent to the field. 
He attended the Friends' meetings, and was a man whom to know was to 
respect and honor. 

Reuben W'arford Ryan pursued his education in the ])ul)lic schools of

Philadelphia until fourteen years of age. when he began clerking in a store, 
in which capacity he was employed until embarking in busmess on his own 
account as a dealer in groceries at the corner of Frankford road and Adams 
street On the 12th of August. 1889. he came to Wildwood and established 
his present general mercantile business. He has built up a very large trade, 
two wagons being required to deliver the goods. His sales amount annually 
to thirtv-five thousand dollars, and he occupies a store room forty-eight by 
fortv-eight feet, with an addition fort>- by sixty feet. He also has a store- 
room eighteen bv thirty feet, which he rents. He deals in general merchan- 
dising and during the summer season controls one of the largest trades m 
southern New Jersey. He makes a specialty of handling f^ne china, and his 
important souvenir and china store adjoining his mammoth bazaar embraces 
the handsomest wares from Japan. China and Austria, much of which is pre- 
pared to order for Mr. Ryan. His store is built in handsome Gothic style 
of architecture and the internal arrangement is most convenient, tasteful and 

artistic. 

On the 1 2th of August. 1889. Mr. Ryan was united in marriage to -Miss 
Henrietta Sauerton. of Rancocas. New Jersey, and they have three children. 
—Norman W.. Alta and William Kenneth. The parents occupy a promi- 
nent position in social circles, and their circle of .friends is extensive. Mr. 
Ryan is regarded as one of the most successful business men of Wildwood. 
and his prosperity is the merited reward of his own labors: for from a humble 
clerkship he has 'worked his way steadily upward to a position of affluence. 
Thoroughly progressive and enterprising, he is an important factor in the 
upbuilding and progress of Wildwood. and owns considerable real estate in 
this place^and in Holly Beach. He served as the postmaster of Wildwood 
from 1889 until 1898. and has served as a delegate to congressional and 
county conventions, being one of the ardent supporters of the Republican 
party.' He has also been a member of the village council and exercised his 
official prerogatives to advance the welfare and upbuilding of the place. 
Socially he is connected with Cape Island Lodge. No. 35. F. & A. M.. and 
with the Roval Arcanum. His marked enterprise, his fidelity to his duties of 
citizenship, his superior business ability and his social prominence all entitle 
him to representation among the leading citizens of Cape May county.

JOSEPH T. SICKLER. 



The name which introduces this review is one which is familiar to the 
residents of southern New Jersey, for through many generations representa- 
tives of the Sickler family have resided in Gloucester county. The subject 
of this re\iew is one of the leading attorneys in Gloucester county and is a 
recognized leader of public thought and opinion. His influence in the affairs 
of this section of the state has been most marked, and his efiforts have led to 
advancement along social, educational, moral and material lines. Fitted by 
native courage and intellectual ability to direct afYairs and to assume respon- 
sibility, he has steadily won his way to a position of eminence among the rep- 
resentative men of New Jersey. 

Mr. Sickler was born April 27, 1852, in Mantua, Gloucester county, and 
is of German lineage. At an early period in the development of the state 
Joshua Sickler took up his abode at Chew's Landing, now Camden. New 
jersev. and l)ecame the founder of the family in this section of the country. 
The year of his arrival was probably 1662. Christopher Sickler, the great- 
grandfather of our subject, was born at Chew's Landing and reared six chil- 
dren, namely: Elizabeth, John R., Jason. Joshua. Rebecca and, Mary. 
Throughout the long years which have been added to the cycle of eternity 
since Joshua Sickler established his home at Chew's Landing, representa- 
tives of the family have been prominent in the affairs which have gone to 
make up the history of the state, and in various departments of life have at- 
tained to eminent positions. Dr. John R. Sickler. the father of our subject.

370 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

On the /th of Septeml:)er, 1897. Mr. Sickler was united in marriage to 
Miss Lucy G. Gill, a daughter of Judge David B. Gill, who was for many 
years accounted one of the leading men of this locality. His father, Matthew 
Gill, was at an early day a successful and prominent merchant at Clarksboro. 
and was descended from the Clark family in whose honor the town was 
named. Judge Gill was born in 181 1 and died in 1894. in Clarksl)oro. his 
native town. He was a very progressive man and was one of the builders 
of the West Jersey & Delaware Railroad. He recognized the value of secur- 
ing rapid transit and excellent means of transportation, and. believing that 
railroad building was a profitable investment, he promoted his own success 
while at the same time he advanced public prosperity through railroad con- 
struction. He was a director of the old Camden & Amboy Railroad, and 
was well known in railroad circles. During the period of the rebellion he held 
the important office of sheriff of Gloucester county, and later he was ap- 
pointed judge by the joint assembly of the state legislature for one term. In 
politics he was a stanch Republican, unswerving in his advocacy of. the prin- 
ciples of the party. He married Sarah Hendrie, of Marietta, Ohio, and to 
them were born two children: Francis Wood, a resident of Topeka, Kansas: 
and Lucy G.. the wife of Joseph T. Sickler. The mother is still living, her 
home being in Clarksboro. 

Mr. Sickler is also prominent in political circles, but his views are in ac- 
cord with Democratic principles. His close study of the questions of the 
day enables him to give an intelligent support to the party of his choice and 
to uphold his position by strong argument. He has been an active factor 
in many campaigns, — congressional, district and state. \\'hen hardly more 
than a boy he was the overseer of the poor in Mantua township, and in 1896 
he was a candidate for sheriff on the Democratic ticket. He ran seven hun- 
dred and thirty-five votes ahead of his ticket, but could not overcome the very 
strong Republican majority which is always to be found in Gloucester county. 
For many years he has been a member of the Democratic township committee 
and is one of the advising committee and the \ice chairman to the Demo- 
cratic county committee. His labors in l^ehalf of Democracy have been tmtir- 
ing and effective. He is public-spirited in an eminent degree. National 
progress and local advancement are causes both dear to his heart, and he is 
ever true and faithful to his duties of citizenship. Socially Mr. Sickler is a 
member of the Masonic lodge of Mantua, the Improved Order of Red Men. 
the Knights of Pythias fraternity and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows 
of Clarksboro. Courteous, genial, well informed, alert and enterprising, he 
stands to-dav one of the leading and representative men of his state- — a man 
■who is a power in his conmiunity.

JOHN O'NEIL. 

Tohn O'Xeil is one of the conspicuous citizens of Xewfield, not alone l^e- 
cause he is the proprietor of the well known rug factory located at that point 
but also for his many amiable characteristics and sterling worth. He was 
born in the citv of Philadelphia, on Christmas day. 1850, and is a son of 
John O'Neil, a native of Ireland who came to the United States in 1836, 
when a voung man. He was a mason by trade and followed that business in 
Philadelphia, where he made his home. He was industrious and thrifty and 
accumulated a sufficient competence to allow him to spend the evening of 
life in comfort and leave a nucleus of worldly comforts for his children. He 
was a devout Catholic and a man of temperate habits, — a fact that no doubt 
had much to do with the extreme longevity of his life. He died in Septem- 
ber. 1893, after rounding- out ninety years of life. He chose as the sharer of 
his joys and sorrows Miss Annie Guckin, who died in 1873. after having had 
in the course of life nine children, five of whom are now li\ing. \iz. : Eliza. 
the widow of Samuel Parnell. of Philadelphia: Mary Ann. Mrs. M. P. Hani- 
gan, of the same city; Maggie, the widow of Thomas Downing, also of Phila- 
delphia: Ellen, who is a spinster: and John, the subject of this biography. 

John O'Neil attended the Harrison grammar school of his native city 
during his tender years and at the age of twelve began work in a carpet mill, 
his first employment being that of winding bobbins. In November, 1864. 
when he was fourteen, he secured a place under the government in the quar- 
termaster's department, where he remained fourteen months. The war over 
he went back to his old trade of wea\'ing and continued in it many years, 
learning the minutest detail of the business and laying the foundation of 
that success which has attended his efi'orts since commencing an independent 
business for himself. His first venture was in 1880, in Philadelphia, when 
he began the manufacture of rugs. Five years later, in 1883. in company 
with James C. Morrow, of Delaware, he equipped the factory of the Smyrna 
Rug Company of Newfield and has worked up a splendid business here. They 
make all sizes of rugs and ship their products to all parts of the countrv. meet- 
ing with a ready market. They have one hundred hands constantly employed 
and have an annual income of one hundred thousand dollars from the sale 
of their goods. The business has assumed such ]iroportions that it has been 
found necessary to enlarge the plant, and this they are now doing. It is 
such men as Mr. O'Neil that make a town. — men who are full of push and 
vim. He has worked his own way from the lowest ])Osition in tlie line and is 
deserving of credit for the perse\'erance with which he stuck to the

business. He is a typical self-made man anrl his life is well worthy of emula- 
tion. 

On December 25. 1873, '^^ ^^'^s joined in the holy bonds of wedlock with 
Miss Margaret Wood, a daughter of Henry Wood, of Philadelphia. Seven 
children have honored this marriage, five of whom still sur\i\e. Thev are 
Elizal^eth. Agnes, Regina, Mary and Margrett. They are all unmarried ex-

JAMES C. JONES. 



When by native force of character a man achieves success, in spite of 
circumstances and obstacles difficult to overcome, more credit is given to 
him by the people of this democratic country- than if he was the inheritor 
of vast wealth or title; and this is one of our proudest boasts. When, more- 
over, a citizen gives e\'idence that he is not self-centered, but holds his duty 
to his country and the public of paramount importance, added glory should 
be his, and his example is worthv of emulation. 

In tracing the history of J. C. Jones, an industrious, unassuming citizen 
of Franklin township, Gloucester county, it is seen that lie is a self-made 
man and a true patriot. His fatlier, Samuel Jones, was born near Centerton, 
Salem county. New Jersey, and departed this life in 1854. He was an agri- 
culturist, owning a small farm, and was an honest. God-fearing man, re- 
spected and loved by all. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal 
church, and gave all that he could to the cause of Christ. He married Chris- 
tiana Kandle, a daughter of John Kandle, of Salem county, but death took 
her from his home in 1848. 

r)f the eight children born to this worthy cou])le. J. C. Jones is the only 
survivor. He was born in Salem comity, on a farm near Mullica Hill, Janu- 
ary 17, 1838. As his mother died when he was a lad of ten years, he went 
to live with his uncle Henry, w hose home was near Willow Grove, Cumber- 
land county. When the youth was nineteen years of age he went to Mullica 
Hill, and for a few years thereafter he was employed upon farms in that 
vicinity. In September. 1862, he enlisted in Company I, Twenty-fourth 
New Jersey Volunteers, at the Lake, and for the ensuing ten months was en- 
gaged in active service in the Union army, during that period taking part in 
the battle of Chancellorsville and others of less importance. Returning home, 
he resumed his interrupted duties, and since that time has been actively 
interested in the cultivation and improvement of his farm, which comprises 
one hundred and seventv acres. He has been honored with several local 



CONGRESSIO.X'AL DISTRICT OF NEJl' JERSEY. 373 

public offices of trust and responsibility, and has been a class-leader, trustee 
and steward in the Methodist Episcopal church at the Lake. His marriage 
to Mrs. JNIargaret Downs was celebrated July 29. 1861. and of their two chil- 
dren one is deceased, and the other, James W., resides near the old home- 
stead belonging to our subject. 



JAMES \'. COXOVER. M. D. 

To minister to the sick and suffering, to carry cheer, sympathy and aid 
to those in pain and afifiiction, — can a nobler field of usefulness lie found? 
Perhaps no one can quite frll the place of the Christian physician, as he 
goes from house to house in a community, carrying with him an atmosphere 
of strength, vitality and hope. One of the loved and esteemed physicians of 
Salem county is the gentleman whose name heads this sketch. — a ^•alued 
member of the medical profession of this section of the state. 

The Conover familv originated in Holland several generations ago. and 
the sterling qualities for -w hich the people of that country are noted are to be 
found in those bearing the name to-day. Two brothers founded the family on 
the hospitable shores of the Xew World, one making a permanent settlement 
on Manhattan island and the other locating in New Jersey. Elisha Conover. 
a son of John Conover, the Doctor's father, was born in this state, and for a 
livelihood made agriculture his chief business. For a period in his earlv life 
he was successfully engaged in teaching, and from the time that he arrived 
at man's estate until his death. July 13. 1897. he was an active and valued 
member of the Methodist church. ser\ing as a class-leader and as one of the 
official board of the congregation with which his lot was cast. He attained 
the ripe age of eighty-four years, and his widow, who is still living, is now in 
her seventy-eighth year. Her maiden name was Eliza \'an ]\leter. lier father 
being James Van Meter, of one of the old, respected families of Xew Jersey, 
of Holland-Dutch extraction. 

Dr. J. V. Conover. who was l)orn July 12. 1835. in the identical house in 
the village near W'oodstown. Salem county, in which his father's birth had 
occurred more than two-score years previously, is one of the seven children 
born to Elisha and Eliza Conover. The eldest. Lovisa. is the wife of Charles 
Huff, of Harrisonville. Gloucester county. Howard J. is a minister in the 
Methodist denomination, at present located at Mullica Hill, Gloucester 
county, and Samuel is engaged in farming in the vicinity of Harrisonville, 
Xew Jersey. Professor Elisha Conover. the youngest son. is a leading edu- 
cator, a man of superior attainments and l)ri]]iant prospects. He is a grad-

uate of Dickinson College and now occupies the chair of Latin and Greek 
at the Delaware University, at Newark, Delaware. .Vnna. the youngest sur- 
\iving- daughter, is the wife of C. C. Avis, of Woodstown, New Jersey. 

The advantages of a liberal education fell to Dr. Conover in his youth, 
his higher studies being pursued in the seminary at Pennington. New Jersew 
After attending that well known institution of learning for two years he 
turned his attention to the subject of medicine, and in 1880 he was graduated 
in the Eclectic ]Medical Institute at Cincinnati. Ohio. Subsequently he re- 
turned to this, his nati\'e state, and engaged in the practice of his chosen 
\ocation for two years, after which he went to the west. There he remained 
for some time, gaining the experience which he desired in his work, and at 
the same time benefiting himself by meeting with the varied classes of people 
found in the west, and having his mind broadened and strengthened by travel 
and association with nature in all her phases. Returning home in September, 
1897, he established himself in practice in Elmer, Salem county, where he 
has built up a large and lucrative patronage. When in the west he served 
for some time as a pension examining surgeon and physician at the cit_\- 
hospital. He is identified with the Knights of Pythias and belongs to the 
local lodge of the Masonic order. From childhood inoculated with the prin- 
ciples and beauties of the Methodist creed and doctrine, he earl_\- became 
a member of the church and is now acting in the capacity of trustee of the 
Elmer congregation. 

His marriage was solenmized November 26. 1895. the lady of his choice 
being Alice W. Sniffin. a daughter of Nathaniel Sniffin. of New York. She 
possesses an excellent education and is ver\' ]30i)ular in church and social cir- 
cles, as is also her husband. 



RETURN B. SWAIN. 



The fitting reward of a long and actix'e business career is an honored 
retirement from labor in which to enjoy the fruits of former toil. Mr. Swain, 
after manv \ears' identification with incKistrial and corjimercial interests in 
this section of the countr\-. is now fixing retired near Cape ]\Iay Court House, 
having in former years actiuired a handsome competence and considerable 
real estate, both city and farm property, the income from which supplies him 
with all the comforts and many of the luxuries of life.

with Jeremiah Bass, who was the agent for the London proprietors of the 
west Jersey shore. Mr. Bass was employed in the whale fisheries and brought 
to New Jersey a colonv of those who were employed by him. At a later date 
Richard' Swain, Sr.. also arrived in this county. Lemuel Swain, the paternal 
grandfather of our subject, who was the son of Silas Swain, who died May 
8 I79S was born in Lower township. Cape May county, and became a pilot

tion to the questions which puzzled liim. He not only became proficient in 
the elementary mathematical branches, but also mastered mensuration, sur- 
veying and navigation. The same energy and determination which prompted 
him to gain a good education in the face of difficulties have enabled him to 
\\-ork his way steadily upward in the business world to a position of promi- 
nence. He followed farming until thirty-nine years of age and then located in 
Cape May City, where he engaged in surveying. He also built the first water- 
works there and laid the sewer system of the town at his own expense and 
.risk, spending several thousand dollars. The two systems, however, were 
perfectly satisfactory and were accepted by the town. He was the superin- 
tendent of the gas-works for twelve years, during which time he rebuilt and 
enlarged the plant and developed the works, which he successfully conducted 
until his removal to Philadelphia in 1880. making his home in that city until 
1897. K[6 was there engaged in the manufacture of bath tubs, at No. 1701

SAMUEL A. RIDGWAY. 

Samuel A. Ridg\vay is one of the truly self-made men of Salem county, 
as he started out to fight in the battle of life empty-handed, but with the 
brave heart and spirit which commands success, sooner or later. His ad- 
vantages in the direction of school education, as well, were limited, but his 
keen powers of observation and habits of reading and study have made him 
one of the best informed men in his neighborhood. 

The birth of Mr. Ridgway took place in Gloucester county, this state, in 
1848. His father, Richard S. Ridgway. was the youngest of a family of eleven 
children, the others being named respectively: Naomi, Job, Ann, Phoebe, 
Daniel, Samuel, Jacob, Josiah, John and Lydia. Their parents were Jacob 
and Keziah (Pedrick) Ridgway. of Burlington county. New Jersey, active 
members of the Society of Friends. Jacob Ridgway lived to reach the ripe 
age of four-score years. Richard S. Ridgway, the father of our subject, was 
a man of sterling worth, a strong, noble character, influential in all good 
works in his community. He died at the home of our subject, on the 14th 
of January, 1898, when in his eighty-second year. He had lived a retired life 
for about ten years, but until he was more than three-score and ten was 
busily engaged in running a farm which he owned, situated near Harrison- 
ville, Gloucester county. That homestead is now in the hands of his son, 
Richard, who became its purchaser some years ago. The wife and mother, 
whose maiden name was Sarah Ann Kstell, and whose birthplace was in Cape 
May county. New Jersey, is yet living, now being eighty years of age. She 
was the mother of five sons, of whom only one, George G., is deceased, and 
the others are John E., Samuel A., Jacob H. and Richard D. 

The early years of Samuel A. Ridgway were passed in the usual pursuits 
of country lads, and from the time he was seventeen until he was twenty he 
worked for farmers by the month. Then, going to Burlington county, this 
state, he was employed by Jacob E. Ridgway for three years, winning the 
golden opinions of all with whom he had dealings. His next move was to 
embark in business on his own account, and as he had been economical and 
husbanded his resources he was enabled to rent a farm and purchase the 
necessary implements and equipments for carrying on the place properly. 
After renting a homestead of Amos Gant for three years, he leased one of 
Aaron Borton, of Mullica Hill, for a year, and subsequently managed the 
Jacob E. Ridgway farm at Bordentown, Burlington county, for a period of 
ten years. In 1887 he removed to his present farm, which he bought the 
ensuing year and has successfully carried on ever since. The place, which

is one of the Ijest in Piles Grove township, comprises one hundred and ten 
acres, and upon it stands su1)stantial liuiidings and other improvements. 

In his struggles to acquire a competence and honored position in the 
community, Mr. Ridgway has been ably aided by his estimable wife, Eliza- 
beth, to whom he was married March 12, 1873. She is a daughter of Amos 
and Rachel Kirby. farmers, of Mullica Hill, Gloucester countv, and her 
brothers and sisters are: Maggie P., wife of William F. Iredell: Mary, who 
first wedded Ephraim Coles and after his death became the wife of Samuel 
Iredell; George, deceased; Christiana, the widow of Walter Edwards; Clayton 
J-, Edward and Erank. Amos Kirby, who now is in his eighty-sixth year, is 
a son of Job and Mary Kirby, formerly of Woodstown. Mrs. Rachel Kirby 
departed this life in 1897, when she was in her seventy-ninth year. To the 
union of our subject andi wife two sons and a daughter were born, namely: 
Lillian, who died when two years old; and Frank K. and Harry G., both 
promising young men, who have been well trained at home in the duties of 
citizenshi]! and are taking a worthx' place in the busv world. 



NATHAN A, COHEN. M. D. 

The ranks of the medical jirofession are continual! v being repleted b}- the 
graduates of our medical colleges, some of whom enter the fraternity to meet 
failure, some to secure only a moderate degree of success and others to leave 
the ranks of the many and stand among the successful few, occupying a 
position of eminence by reason of their pronounced ability, comprehensive 
knowledge and superior skill. To this last class belongs Dr. Cohen. His 
studies have been most thorough and exhaustive, embracing every branch 
of the science of medicine, and special preparation in many lines has made 
him particularly skilled in many departments of his chosen calling. 

Nathan Alexander Cohen was born in the eighth ward of Philadelphia, 
July 4, 1864, and is a son of Theodore Tobias and Henrietta (Seaman) Cohen. 
His father was a painter by trade and spent his entire life in Philadelphia. 
He had six children: Esther is the wife of Joseph Simpson, who is engaged 
in the iron foundry business in Newark, Ohio, and had two children, — Nathan 
Alexander and Thomas T., the latter of whom died in infancy; M. Daniel is 
a painter of Philadelphia: Lesser Philip is associated with his brother Nathan 
in the drug business under the firm name of Cohen Brothers, having a store 
at Wildwood and one at 6235 Lancaster avenue, Philadelphia, and he is the 
manager of the latter: Julia is the wife of John Shaldice, deceased: the Doctor 



COXGRESSfOXAL DISTRICT OF XEW JERSEY. 379 

is the next of the family; and Ameha died in infancy. The father's death 
occurred November 4, 1889, in his seventieth year, but the mother is still liv- 
ing, at the age of seventy years. 

Dr. Cohen pursued his education in the public schools of Philadelphia, 
and then accepted a clerkship in the drug store of E. J. Davidson & Com- 
pany, of that citv, with whom he remained for a year and a half. He after- 
ward spent two vears as a salesman with Mussell & Housekeeper, and then 
spent six months in the University of Pennsylvania in experimenting in the 
anatomical laboratory. Subsequently he was with Henry A. Borell, a drug- 
gist, for a vear, then with the George W. Carpenter Henzy Company for 
one year, and with the Rosengarten Chemical Company, as assistant, m 
charge of the department. 

He was graduated at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in the class 
of 1886, and spent three years in the veterinary department of the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania, being graduated with the class of 1890. He is a grad- 
uate of the Jefiferson Medical College of the class of 1892 and opened an 
office in Hammonton, New Jersey, where he engaged in the practice of medi- 
cine for a vear. His health becoming impaired he went to Camden, New^ 
Jersey, where he continued for eighteen months, and on the 5th of Novem- 
ber, 1895, he came to Wildwood, where he has since successfully engaged in 
the practice of medicine, making a specialty of surgery, in which he is excep- 
tionally proficient. He has performed some exceedingly difficult and delicate 
operations, which have attracted the attention of the profession and won him 
prestige with the public. He has not only pursued a general course of study 
in medicine and surgery but also spent one year with the celebrated surgical 
specialist. Dr. William W. Keen, of Philadelphia, and with Dr. Orville G. • 
Harivitz and J. S. Cohen in the study of diseases of the nose and throat. He 
is a member of the Cape May County Medical Society, and occupies a posi- 
tion in medical circles second to none in this section of the state. His prep- 
aration for his chosen calling was most comprehensive and thorough, and 
added to this is a sympathy for his fellow men without which no one can lie 
entirely successful in the medical profession. In 1894 he established a drug 
store, which he conducts in connection with his practice. 

Socially the Doctor is connected with Cape Island Lodge, No. 30, F. & 
A. M.; General Marion Lodge, No. 6, I. O. O. F., of Philadelphia: and 
Friendship Lodge, A. O. U. W. He is a gentleman of social manner, genial 
temperament and kindly disposition, qualities which render him popular 
and win him many friends. His acquaintance is extensive, and he enjoys the 
high regard of all with whom he comes in contact. 



38o BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

CHARLES HIRES. 

Charles Hires, a glass manufacturer and farmer, has been closely asso- 
ciated with the various business interests of Salem, Salem county. New 
Jersey. Keen and discerning in his judgments, he has exercised great care 
in his investments and to-day is considered one of the wealthy men of the 
county. 

Mr. Hires was born October 27, 1842, in Lower Penn's Neck t(iwnship. 
Salem county, and is the youngest of a large family. His father, George 
Hires, was a prominent farmer of his day. As a boy the subject of this sketch 
developed traits of character that were destined eventually to lead him to a 
successful life. Industry and perseverance, twin virtues, have been exempli- 
fied in him throughout his whole career. 

He received a rather meager education, two or three months during the 
winter of each year, being the extent of a farm boy's educational pri\ileges 
in those days. One instance will serve to show the kind of boy Air. Hire? 
was. It was the fashion for each village or community to have its debating 
society, and the village of Ouinton, where he then lived with his parents, 
had such a one, composed of the schoolmaster and others who were inter- 
ested in education and the broadening of their minds. Mr. Hires, who was 
at that time about fourteen years old, conceived the idea that he would like 
to join this society, notwithstanding the fact that he was at that age when 
most boys would much rather plav than listen to a debate, and that all the 
other members of the societv were much older than himself, many of them 
being middle-aged and old men. Xo doubt this society was of great benefit 
to him, since it taught him to think correctly and logically and has been 
probably one of the chief causes of his superior judgment of affairs in his 
later years. 

He joined the great army of wage-earners at the age of seventeen, having 
secured a position as clerk in the general store of Smith & Hires, at Ouinton, 
New Jersey, his brother, George Hires, being the junior member of this firm. 
After working for this firm for about two years, he bought Mr. Smith's inter- 
est and for about one year thereafter the business was conducted under the 
firm name of George & Charles Hires. June 15, 1863, when our subject 
was still in his 'teens, he associated with his brother, George Hires, David P. 
Smith and John Lambert, under the firm name of Smith, Hires, Lambert & 
Compan)', for the manufacture of window glass, and built a factory at Ouin- 
ton, New Jersey, which began operations October 24, 1863. Mr. Hires re- 
mained in the glass business until January i, 1867, when his wife's father, 
Aimer Smith, a farmer of Lower Alloway Creek township, having recently

died he sold his interest in the manufactor>- to George R. :Morrison. late 
surrogate, and removed to the farm, where he began his first real experience 
as an agriculturist. He spent four successful years as a farmer and m 1871 
moved "to Salem. New Jersey, thinking that he would retire from active busi- 
ness- but his age— he was onlv twenty-nine years old— and natural inchna- 
tions would not permit of an inactive life, so in a few months he again became 
a member of the glass firm at Ouinton. of which firm he has remamed a 
member ever since. Mr. Hires is one of the largest stockholders in the 
Hires-Turner Glass Companv of Philadelphia. Pennsylvania. This company 
was formerlv known as Hires & Company. Limited, and was established in 
1878. bv the then members of the firm of Hires & Company, at Qmnton. 
New Je'rsev. The business grew rapidly and in 1892 the firm was changed 
to a stock' company and is to-day one of the largest and most flourishing 
business enterprises of its character in the city of Philadelphia. Mr. Hires 
is one of the largest land-owners in Salem county. In addition to farming 
propertv, he owns considerable residence and business property in the city 
of Salem. He is a director in the Fanners" Mutual Fire Insurance Comjiany 
of Salem. New Jersey, and is also a stockholder in the City National and 
Salem National Banks. 

In poHtics Mr. Hires has been a lifelong Republican and an intelligent 
worker in the ranks of that party. He is a member of the Fenwick Lodge. 
I. O. O. F.. the Fenwick Club and an honored member of the First Presby- 
terian church, in which he has served as a trustee for the past ten years. Mr. 
Hires was united in marriage. December 28. 1864, to Susanna Du Bois Smith, 
the only daughter of Abner Smith, a prominent farmer of Lower Alloway 
Creek township. Five children have been added to the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
Hires, namelv: Abner Smith, who was born April 8. 1868. educated in the 
South Jersey Institute at Bridgeton. New Jersey, and in Princeton College, 
and assisted his father in his business. He was married in 1890 to Miss Eliza- 
beth H. Patrick, by whom he has three children, Russell R.. Susanna D. and 
Helen E. Dr. Nathaniel Stretch Hires, bom July 15. 1870, received his edu- 
cation during his earlier years in Ouinton and Salem and then entered the 
medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with the 
degree of Doctor of Medicine. June 7. 1894. He took a post-graduate course 
of one year in the Polyclinic Hospital in Philadelphia, and was a resident 
physician at the Cooper Hospital, of Camden, New Jersey, for more than a 
vear. -\t present he is located and practicing medicine in the city of Salem. 
Dr. Hires is a member of the Salem County and the New Jersey State Medi- 
cal Societies, the Fenwick Club, the Salem County Club and Knights of 
Pvthias. Charles Royal Hires was born February i. 1873. and was educated

JOB BICKNELL ELLIS, A. M. 

The angle of human knowledge is constantly broadening as men of 
strong mentality and keen discernment carry their researches further and 
further into the realms of science, discovering facts new to the world, which 
add to the sum of human wisdom. In no department of knowledge have 
greater discoveries been made in the last century than in Ijotanical lines, and 
one of the pioneers in a new field of original investigation is J. B. Ellis, whose 
labors have added much to man's understanding of the plant kingdom, espe- 
cially concerning mycology. His name deserves a place on the pages of 
history by the side of Asa Gray and others of note, and is a familiar one in 
the circle of our country's greatest botanists and deepest students of the 
plant life. He lives a very quiet, secluded life in his home in Newfield, but 
the results of his labors have gone forth to the world in many volumes of ines- 
timable value that have won him the admiration and gratitude of the most 
learned botanists of the land. 

Mr. Ellis was born in Potsdam, St. Lawrence countv. New York, Tanuarv 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEIV JERSEY. 383 

21, 1829. The family originated in England and was probably founded in 
America at an early period in the colonial history of the country. His 
grandfather, Isaac Ellis, and his father. Freeman Ellis, were both natives of 
Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The latter took up his abode in St. Lawrence 
county. New York, when that section of the state was an almost unbroken 
wilderness, and Ijecame an adept in handling the ax and in clearing away the 
forests in order to cultivate the land. He developed a fine farm there and 
made his home thereon until his death, which occurred in 1854. He served 
as a deacon in the Baptist church and was a man of sterling worth and great 
force of character. His wife bore the maiden name of Sarah Bicknell and 
was a daughter of Amos Bicknell, of \>rmont, whose people were pioneers 
of the Green Mountain state, and very wealthy and influential people. She 
died May 24, 1875. By her marriage she became the mother of six children, 
four of whom are now living: Job Bicknell, of this review; Allen, a resident 
of Minnesota; and Carleton and Carlos (twins), who are residents of Pots- 
dam, New York. 

J. B. Ellis was reared upon his father's farm and early began to assist in 
the cultivation of the fields. He attended the country schools of the neigh- 
borhood, and evinced a great fondness for study, devoting all of his leisure 
hours to his books. At the age of sixteen he was employed to teach the 
winter school at Stockholm, St. Lawrence county, where he was to receive 
ten dollars a month for his services, and "board round" among his pupils. 
Five of the ten dollars was paid in cash and the other five was to be paid in 
grain, and twenty years elapsed before he received all of the cereal! Having 
completed his academical course he entered Union College, at Schenectady. 
New York, in the fall of 1849, but at the end of the term he was obliged to 
put aside his text-books and seek a position in order to replenish his ex- 
hausted exchequer. In company with A. B. Smith, later a prominent lawyer, 
he started on foot to Saratoga county, hoping to secure a school there, and 
after traveling through the dense pine woods they at length arrived at the 
village of Charlton. There Mr. Ellis secured the position he desired, and 
subsequently was enabled to complete his college course, being graduated in 
Union College with the degree of A. B. Since that time his alma mater has 
conferred upon him the degree of A. M. 

After his graduation Mr. Ellis went to Germantown. Pennsylvania, and 
accepted a position as teacher in a school conducted by the Rev. D. Wash- 
burrie. He had studied botany a little at college but it was while in German- 
town that he liegan to take an active interest in phanerogamic botany, little 
dreaming of what the outcome would be. In November, 1851. he severed his 
connection with the school and entered the Albany (New York) Academy 



384 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

as a classical teacher, remainino- there one }ear. This position was better 
suited to his taste, for he had decided to become a professional teacher of 
classics. George H. Cook, later the state geologist of New Jersey, was the 
principal of the academy. The evenings of Mr. Ellis were spent in making 
blow-pipe analyses of minerals in company with G. W. Taylor, a fellow tutor. 
In connection with Mr. Taylor he established a select school the following 
year, but the venture did not prove a ]3rofitable one. and after three months 
Mr. Ellis returned to Potsdam. 

During that time, however, he saw by chance a notice of Ravenel's Fungi 
Caroliniani Exsiccati. the first thing of the kind ever issued in America. 
While in college he had frequently noticed the agarics, but not knowing 
where to get books or information concerning fungi let them alone. But 
upon seeing the notice of Ravenel's collection he wrote to him and then 
commenced a correspondence, in 1857, which lasted until Ravenel's death, 
interrupted only by the war. He continued collecting phanerogams until 
1870, at the same time giving gradually more and more time to fungi. In 
1870 he sold his phanerogamic collection, containing about one thousand 
species, to St. Lawrence University, Canton, New York. 

In May, 1853, Mr. Ellis became a classical teacher in a Mr. Bartlett's 
boarding school in Poughkeepsie, New York, where he remained for two 
years, \\niile there, in connection with Professor Buckhout, he devoted his 
Saturdays to collecting plants, and his Sundays were spent in the same way. 
— "if we could steal away: for Mr. Bartlett was very pious." In February. 
1855, in company with his sister. Mrs. L. B. Doud, he left Poughkeepsie for 
Charleston, South Carolina, expecting to secure a position as teacher there, 
but already the sectional difference was manifest and prevented his obtaining 
a school in Charleston. He then went to Alexander, Georgia, where he was 
employed as a teacher, but in 1856 he returned to Potsdam. Here, on the 
19th of April, of that year, he married Miss Arvilla J. Bacon, who became 
his most able assistant in his labors, making it possible to accomplish his 
enormous and valuable work in the interest of American mycology. She 
was always associated with him in his botanical interests and labors until 
her death, which occurred July 18, 1899. Their only child, a daughter, is now 
one of New York's most ])opular professional musicians. 

In the fall of iS^d Mr. Ellis became the principal of Canton .\cadeniy, 
and in 1863 both he and his wife began teaching in the puldic schools of Pots- 
dam. There Mr. Ellis remained until September, 1864, when he joined the 
United States na\y at Brooklyn, New 'S'ork. and spent the winter of 1864-5 
on the United States steam frigate Susquehanna of the North Atlantic Block-

ading Squadron. He was present at the bombardment of Fort Fisher tliree 
days in December. 1864, and three days in January. 1865. when the fort was 
taken. While on the war ship he became acquainted with Mr. Hale, from 
New Jersey, who told him of the good climatic conditions in Xewfield and 
vicinity, and at the close of the war, in the spring of 1865. he returned to his 
native'town and removed his worldly possessions to Newfield. where he has 
since made his home. 

Since 1878 he has devoted his entire time and attention to fungi, desiring 
to disseminate more widely a knowledge of North American fungi and to 
arouse home botanists if possible from their apathetic indifference toward 
these plants. He decided to begin in a modest way, by issuing ten sets of 
New Jersev fungi, under the title of "Fungi Nova-Caesarienses." He put 
up ten "centuries" on sheets of paper in boxes. Of the two sets sold one 
went to Dr. Farlow, the other to Isaac C. Martindale. About this time Mr. 
Ellis went to see the latter gentleman, who asked. "Why not call it North 
American Fungi?" Mr. Ellis, seeing the greater appropriateness and scope 
of such a title, recalled the two sets and concluded to get out a series of cen- 
turies in bound volumes, entitled North American Fungi. At that time he 
was so pressed for means that he had not money enough to get the books 
made for the first two centuries. Thereupon Professor Farlow, who favored 
the scheme, had the books made in Boston and advanced them to Mr. Ellis, 
who paid for them as soon as he was able. The centuries took welt from the 
start, and from thirty-five sets to begin with, the demand rapidly increased 
up to fifty-three sets, which number of copies has been issuetl regularly for 
some years past. Altogether thirty-six centuries have been issued, or about 
three thousand separate volumes have been made, filled with specimens, and 
sold. Truly, "N. A. F." has become a household phrase with the cryptogamic 
botanists of this country and Europe. 

In all this great undertaking, as well as in others, the cheerful interest 
and practical helpfulness of Mrs. Ellis were constantly apparent. She made 
and bound all the books except the first sixty which Dr. Farlow kindly ad- 
vanced for his friend at the beginning. Nearly all the specimens were cleaned, 
sorted, put into neat pockets, labeled and fastened by her hands. Mr. Ellis 
himself savs that owing to his great correspondence and the enormously bur- 
densome quantitv of material constantly being sent to him for determination 
and comparison, he would not have been able to get out the North American 
Fungi without her valuable aid. The following notice in "Science." of Au- 
gust II. 1899. is a worthy tribute to her memory: 

"In the death of Mrs. Arvilla J. Ellis, of Newfield, New Jersey, on July 



386 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

i8, 1899. there passed away another of those patient workers to whose 
fidehty science owes so much. Not known as a botanist, not a member of a 
scientific society, nor the author of a scientific paper, she nevertheless con- 
tributed more to the advancement of our knowledge of the fungi than many 
of those whose names are frequently appended to scientific articles in the 
journals. Many years ago she began aiding her husband, Mr. J. B. Ellis, in 
the arduous labor of preparing and mounting the specimens for the 'North 
American Fungi' and later for the 'Fungi Columbiani,' and with her own 
hands bound the books in which these were delivered to subscribers. Had it 
not been for her help the first of these great distributions — numbering 3,600 
specimens — would have been suspended early in its history, and the second — 
numbering 1,400 specimens — would never have come into existence. To her 
deft fingers, which wrought so patiently, botanical science is indebted for the 
more than two hundred thousand specimens of the fungi which Mr. Ellis 
distributed to the botanists of the world." 

From 1876 until 1879. not having at that time the books and exsiccati 
collections necessary for independent work, many specimens were sent to 
Dr. M. C. Cooke, who determined and published them in Grevillea. Since 
1880 Mr. Ellis has been associated with Benjamin M. Everhart, who has 
freely placed at his friend's disposal his splendid botanical library and exten- 
sive mycological collections, and to whose aid and counsel Mr. Ellis feels 
greatly indebted. Mr. Ellis made a \'ery complete collection of fungi, said 
to be more complete than any other private collection in the country, and 
sold it to the Columbia College, of New York city, on May 9, 1896. He had 
collected and named over two hundred thousand specimens, which were se- 
cured from all parts of the country. 

In July, 1878, Mr. Ellis was elected a corresponding member of the .Acad- 
emy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In August, 1882, he was elected 
a corresponding member of the Cryptogamic Society of Scotland, and in 
December of the same year was elected corresponding member of Die Kaiser- 
lich-Konigliche Zoologisch-Botanische Gesellschaft in Vienna. ]\Ir. Ellis 
leads a quiet, retired life, well suited to his studious, sensitive nature. .\ 
thorough scholar and linguist, he is familiar with Latin, Greek, German and 
French, and has also a good practical knowledge of Polish, Swedish, Italian 
and Spanish. He has labored in the face of adversity, having not only been 
financially hampered in his early years, but also having to contend against a 
delicate constitution, yet nevertheless he has probably done more than any 
other man in America to advance the knowledge of our native fungi and to 
stimulate the ardor of every student of mycology.

THOMAS BORTOX. 

This gentleman was connected with the agricultural interests of Glou- 
cester county for a number of years, but has retired from farming and is now 
devoting his energies to the real-estate business, his of^ce and home being in 
Mullica Hill. He was born on the 15th of November. 1836, in Piles Grove, 
Salem countw and is a representative of one of the oldest families of America. 
Earlv in the seventeenth century representatives of the name left England 
and crossed the Atlantic to the Xew World, taking up their residence in Bur-

great-grandfather of our suljject. His son. Joel Borton. was the father of 
Aaron Borton, who was born in Burlington county, near Morristown. in the 
year 1810. He became a farmer and took up his residence in Salem county 
in 1852. locating on the tract of land near ^fullica Hill. He successfully con- 
ducted his farm and at the same time labored earnestly for the advancement 
of the Society of Friends, being one of the ministers of that organization. 
His life was upright and honorable and his memory remains as a blessed 
reminiscence to all who knew him. For thirty-fi\'e years he was an honoreil 
resident of Gloucester county, his death occurring in 1887. His wife, who 
bore the maiden name of Lydia Flitcraft. was a daughter of Isaiah Flit- 
craft, and belonged to one of the oldest families of Salem countv. Her 
death occurred in 1873. She was the mother of nine children, eight of whom

ROBERT C. CHEW 



R. C. Chew was horn at Glassboro, Gloucester county. New Jersew Au- 
gust 14. i84(), but has been a resident of his present property near Cecil since 
1873. His parents were Thomas E. and Elizabeth (Miller) Chew, who re- 
sided in this county many years. The father was of English descent, but 
was himself a native of Marsh Lake, where his early life was sjient. He manu- 
factured the first lirick that was made at Clayton, during the year 1850, and 
twenty vears later purchased a farm of two hundred and twenty acres near 
Cecil, where he lived and had a fifteen-acre cranberry bog. He operated a 
sawmill on this property and it was in this mill that he met his death from 
an accident in April. 1872. He was united in wedlock with Miss Elizabeth 
Miller, who presented him with eleven children, six of whom with the widow 
survive him. He was a man of noble character and highly esteemed bv all 
who knew him. The li\-ing children are Susannah H.. the widow oi IMascal 
Bates; Robert C. Sallie N.. William H.. M. M. and Thomas. 

Robert C. Chew was educated in the common schools of Glassboro and 
worked on his father's farm until he attained his majority. He then pur- 
chased a cranberr_\" bog in this vicinity and engaged in the cultivation of that 
berry for the markets, finding is quite a profitable business. In 1873 he 
purchased his present farm of one hundred and four acres, which he has since 
made his home. In 1889 he built a sawmill on the property and has since 
operated it on a very successful basis. His wife was formerly Miss Ruth

HEXRY \V. MARTS. 



The name of Marts is of Swedish origin and the family wliich. bears it 
was planted on American soil at an early day. Jonathan Marts, the grand- 
father of him whose name heads this sketch, was a farmer of Cumlierland 
county. New Jersey, residing at Black Xeck, and in the war of 1812 he loyally 
served his country. His children were as follows: Eliza: Charles, who was 
twice married and followed farming: Jonathan, who married Sarah Whittaker 
and engaged in the lumber business in Bridgeton. New Jersey, for fifty years; 
Jane, the wife of Lewis Dangerbaker; and Susan, the wife of Daniel Piatt, a 
farmer of Hopewell township, Cumberland county, who was the ^uiiervisor 
of streets for a number of years. 

The maternal grandfather of our suljject was William \\'hittaker, who was 
born July 11, 1787. and was married. December 23, 1807. to Rebecca West- 
cott. He was a farmer of Cumberland county. Xew Jersey, and also dealt 
in glass sand. His death occurred in 1829. His wife was born in 1789. Their 
children were Da}-ton, who was born in 1808, and died June 22. 181 1 : .Susan, 
born March 28, 1810: Nathaniel, who was born June 7. 1812, and died the 
following day: Eunice, who \vas born June 20. 18 14. and married David Fith- 
ian, of IMillville; ^Villiam H.. who was born in 1816, and died in 1846: Re- 
becca, deceased, who was born in 1821 and married Dayid Powell and after 
his death became the wife of Ephraim Harris, a merchant: Joseph, who was 
born August 4, 1826, and died in childhood: and Mary Maria, who was born 
November 2, 1828, and married Captain Westcott. 

The parents of our subject were Elija B. and Susan (Whittaker) Marts, 
the former 1)orn December 2(1. 1807. the latter in 1810. The_\- resided at 
Fairton, Cumberland county, and Mr. Marts followed agricultural ])ursuits 
throughout his business career. He owned and operated a farm until the 
inauguration of the civil war. when he removed to Fairton. Xew Jersey, 
where he livefl retired. In his i)olitical affiliations he was a Democrat and in 
religious belief a Methodist, holding the office of trustee for a number of vears 
in the church to which he Ijelonged. He was married, March 3. 1832, to 
Susan W'hittaker, and to them were born seven children. Mary Jane, born 
Jime 12. 1834. married John N. Taylor and removed to Kansas, where Mr. 
Taylor engaged in farming. Their children were: Elizabeth, the wife of

Howard Willis; Rhocia. the wife of C'ajitain Lewis Campljell, of Bridgeton. 
New Jersey: Rebecca, who was horn April ii. 1836, and died August 25. 
1837; and Samuel. Jonathan died August 23. 1848. William, the twin 
brother of Jonathan, was married July 27, 1838, to Anna Collins, of Philadel- 
phia, and their children are Henry T., Harry F.. William, Julia, Emma antl 
Susan. The father of these children engaged in the oyster business in Fair- 
ton, but is now deceased. Henr}-, the subject of this review, is the fourth 
child of Elija E. Marts. Joseph, l)orn in 1843, died on the 24th of June, of 
the same year. David, 1)orn in 1843. married Lattie ,\llcn, and the\- had two 
children, — Araniinda and .Mice. After the death of his first wife he wedded 
.\ddie Stratton, and he is now assistant light-keeper on the Ship-John light- 
house. Elizabeth, the youngest of the family, was born October 19, 1853, 
and died May 13, 1854. The father of our subject died October 16. 1872, 
at the age of sixty-two vears, and the mother passed awa\- in her eightv- 
seventh year. 

Heiu'y W'hittaker ^larts was educated in the iiublic schools and in sub- 
scription schools, which he attended three terms. .\t the age of thirteen, 
however, he put aside his text-books and has since l)een dependent upon 
his own exertions, so that he deser\-es great credit for the success he has 
achieved. He first worked in an o\-ster house in Fairton, but when the civil 
war broke out he put aside all personal considerations and oii'ered his ser- 
\ices to the government, enlisting in Company F, Third New Jersey Infantry, 
originally called the Cumberland Greys. The command was attached to the 
Army of the Potomac and proceeded to Washington, where it was assigned 
to the First Division of the First Corps. JMr. Marts was mustered in May 28,

pleasant relationship with his old army comrades through his connection 
with A. L. Robeson Post, No. 41, G. A. R., at Bridgeton, New Jersey. 

After returning from the south Mr. Marts was engaged in the oyster 
business for a time and later went to sea as mate and second oflficer on the 
Emma L. Porter, a vessel engaged in trade with the \\'est Indies, on which 
he spent two and a half years. He was afterward on the Ella Amsden for 
two years and for eight years sailed on other vessels in the West India and 
coast-line trade. He subsequently learned the carpenter's trade, at which 
he served a five-years apprenticeship. He then engaged in contracting on 
his own account. He was. however, at one time night boss of the works 
of the Rio Grande Sugar Company, at Rio Grande, for seven years, and 
afterward represented the interests of the company as superintendent of their 
extensive possessions in Osceola county, at St. Cloud. Florida, where the 
company owned large plantations and had mammoth interests. There he 
remained for two years, superintending the constructing of their extensive 
sugar mills. At the end of that time he located in Wildwood. New Jersey, 
where he has made his home since 1890. He is one of the leading contractors 
and builders in his section of the county and took the contract for the con- 
struction of the Wildwood Casino, the largest and most important building 
of the place. He also built the addition to the Dayton Hotel, and has erected 
fully two-thirds of the cottages at Wildwood, employing as many as sixty 
men at one time. He is also engaged in the real-estate business as a member 
of the firm of Reeves & Marts, the senior partner remaining in charge of the 
office, which is located at No. 203 Walnut street. Philadelphia. They buy 
lots, build and sell houses, and their real-estate transfers have lieen many 
and have brought to them fair returns upon their investments. 

In his political views Mr. Marts is a stalwart Republican, and was ap- 
pointed postmaster of Wildwood in March. 1897. so that he is the present 
incumbent. He has always taken a deep interest in the success of his party 
and has done all in his power to promote its growth. Socially he is a member

lief Association and was a member of the Board of Health at Anglesea. while 
at the present writing he is ser\'ing on the city council of Wildwood. Such 
in l)rief is the historv of his connection with the public interest of the com- 
numitv. At all times he is public-spirited and an advocate of progress and 
improvement, and his efforts in behalf of the city have been effective and 
beneficial.

previously prominent residents of that place. Thomas E. Chew was born at 
Marsh Lake, where he lived until he was twenty-one years of age, wdien he 
located in Clayton and engaged in the manufacture of brick. He continued 
there twenty years. In 1870 he moved upon a farm of two hundred and 
twenty acres near Cecil, now owned and occupied by his son, M. M. Chew. 
Fifteen acres of this land he changed into a cranberry bog and was very 
successful in the raising of that fruit. He also conducted a sawmill, in 
which he was finally killed, in April, 1872. His wife, Elizabeth ^Miller, sur- 
vi\-es, and is now in her seventy-sixth year. He was a man of sterling worth

FRAXXIS K. DUKE. 

One of the honored veterans of the civil war is Francis Kendrick Duke, 
who is now engaged in contracting and building in Cape May. He was 
born at Harper's Ferry. Virginia. December 7, 1830, and is a representative 
of one of the old and prominent families of that state. The name is of Scotch 
origin and his parents were Francis and Elizabeth (Kendrick) Duke. The

He was a leading and influential citizen, and loyally served his country in the 
war of 181J. He was also a very prominent Mason. He had a membership 
relation with the Presbyterian church, and was a man whom to know was to 
respect and honor. In the family were hve children: Ann married Thomas

1838, when about fifty-five years of age. and the mother's death occurred in 
1871, in the sixty-second year of her age. 

Mr. Duke of this review was educated in the public schools of Pennsyl- 
vania, and putting aside his text-books when fifteen years of age he started 
out in life on his own account, and learned the millwright's trade, serving an 
apprenticeship of three and a half years. He afterward served a two-years 
apprenticeship at the carpenter's trade, and has since engaged in contracting 
and building. He has erected some of the best residences in Cape Alay. In 
forty-eight davs he put up the Piermont Hotel, containing fifty-two rooms. 
He did considerable building in Philadelphia, and was employed many times 
by Frederick Phillips to superintend his building operations. Enterprise 
and energv have characterized his business career, and his close application, 
perseverance and capaljle management have brought to him a good income.

was broken and he sustained other injuries, from which he has never entirely 
recovered. He was also in the seven-days l^attle and the engagements at 
Falmouth and Fredericksburg, and commanded the Fourth Division at the 
convalescent camp in Alexandria, Virginia. He was also wounded at the 
battle of Fair Oaks, by a bullet piercing his leg, was shot in the neck at Sav- 
age Station, and at length, on account of his injuries, he received an honor- 
able discharge in 1863. Enlisting as the seconil lieutenant of his comiiany. 
he was promoted to the rank of captain on the field at Savage Station and was 
the acting cjuartermaster at the battle of Malvern Hill, occupying a position 
of great danger during the hottest of the fight. With an honorable military 
record he returned home, conscious of having faithfully iierfomied his duty 
upon every occasion. 

In 1852 Mr. Duke was united in marriage to Miss Louise Eldredge, and 
to them were born three children: Harriet, at home; Mary, the wife of Sam- 
uel Smythe, who was the private secretary for Frederick Phillips for seven- 
teen years, and resides at Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, with his wife and 
three children, — Frank, Marion and Samuel: and J(jhn. a printer residing in 
Philadelphia, who married Kate McManus and has one cliikl, named Lewis. 

In his political views Mr. Duke has been a stalwart Republican since the 
organization of the party, and is deeply interested in its success. He ser\-ed 
for four years as a member of the city council and for two \-ears \vas an alder- 
man of Cape May. He was also the justice of the jjeace for Lower Cape 
May township for ten years, the coroner for three years and was deputy

United American Mechanics, the Patriotic Order Sons of America, the Seven 
Wise Men of the East, the Red Men and the L^iion League, and is an honor- 
ary member of the fire department. Mr. Duke has made many friends 
through his connection with these organizations and has exemplified the fra- 
ternal spirit and l)enevolent principles on which the societies are based. 

His l)usiness career has ever been honorable and creditable and the suc- 
cess he has won is well merited. Although he has been dependent upon his 
own efiforts from an early age, he has worked his way steadily upward, over- 
coming all obstacles in his path by determined effort. He has ever realized 
that the possibilities of the present and not of the future indicate the path to 
sucess, and following therein he has gained a comfortable competence.

DR. S. F. ASHCRAFT. 

This gentleman was born at Mullira Hill, jnst across the street from his 
present home, on the 19th of December, 1865, and is a worthy representa- 
tive of one of an old and honored family of Gloncester county, but the ances- 
try can be traced still further back, to colonial days, when German emi- 
grants of the name came to the shores of the Xew \\'orld. taking up their 
abode in Massachusetts. The great-grandfather, Samuel Ashcraft, was a 
native of Connecticut and was the first of the name to locate in this section 
of Xew Jersey. The year of his arrival was 1800 and he was accompanied 
by his familv, including his son John, the grandfather of our subject, who 
became one of the most prosperous and well known business men of this sec- 
tion of the state. His energies were devoted to merchandising and the lum- 
ber trade and he was also an extensive peach-grower of Delaware. Maryland. 
His operations along these various lines were conducted on a large scale and 
brought to him handsome financial returns. 

Dr. J. H. Ashcraft, the father of our suljject, was for forty-three }ears a 
distinguished physician of ]\Iullica Hill, where he still makes his home. It 
is often difiicult to tell whether en\ironment or inherited tendencies more 
strongly influences a career, but perhaiis both had their share in shaping the 
destinv of him whose name heads this re\iew. His father l)eing a physician, 
as a child he became interested in the science and practice of medicine, and 
having completed his literary education he began studying with a view of 
joining the medical fraternity. He prepared for his chosen calling in the 
Jefferson Medical College, of Philadelphia, and on the completion of a thor- 
ough course was graduated, in the class of 1888. For fifteen months he was 
in the Cooper Hospital in Camden, and in May, 1890, he came to Alullica 
Hill. His practice has been varied in character and oftentimes has required 
the greatest skill and efficiency. Excellent results have followed his efforts 
and to-day he is enjoying a liberal support from the public. For three rears 
he served as a physician to the poor of Gloucester countv and at the same 
time among his patrons were numbered many of the wealthiest residents of 
this section of the state. He holds membershi]) in the Gloucester Countv 
Medical Society, in the State Medical Society and the American Medical 
Association, and thus keeps thoroughl}^ informed concerning the theories 
and facts which are advanced by other representatives of the profession. 

On the 22d of June. 1898, the Doctor married Miss Mary S. Keithler. a 
daughter of John C. Keithler, of Delaware county, Pennsylvania. Thev 
occupy an enviable position in social circles and the Doctor is a prominent

STACY L. PANCOAST. 

Fortunate is the man who has back of him an ancestry honorable and 
distinguished, and happy is he if his lines are cast in harmony therewith. 
One of the distinguished families of New Jersey is that to which our subject 
belongs; and his own record has added new laurels to the prestige of 
those who bear his patronymic. Through man}- generations the line of 
descent may be traced. The first of the name of whom we have any record is 
John Pancoast. who resided in England, where his people were noted manu- 
facturers of pottery. Representatives of the name are still prominently con- 
nected with that industry in another country. John Pancoast sailed from 
London, England, in the ship Mary, in 1678, and landed at Philadelphia. He 
was elected the sherifif of the London tenth district, which extended from 
Main street in Burlington to Little Egg Harbor on the Atlantic ocean and 
up the Delaware river to Assanipink creek. He had two sons,^ — John and 
Joseph. The latter was the father of Edward Pancoast. who was born in 
Burlington county, New Jersey, and was the great-grandfather of our sub- 
ject. His son, John Pancoast, was born near Clarksboro, New Jersey, and 
married Sarah, a daughter of Bradway and Jane (Waddington) Keasby, of 
Salem county, New Jersey. He moved to Hancock's Bridge, where he re- 
sided until 1810, when he purchased a farm at the north end of Mullica Hill 
and resided there until death. His son Israel was born at Hancock's Bridge 
and learned the tanner's trade of Joseph Ogden, at Swedesboro, New Jer- 
sey, and followed that pursuit for many years at Mullica Hill. He belonged 
to the Society of Friends, which religious faith was that of his ancestors, the 
progenitor, John Pancoast, having been one of the founders of the Friends 
Society in Mullica Hill. Israel Pancoast married Miss Sarah Ann Lippen- 
cot, a daughter of Wallace Lippencot, of Haddonfield, New Jersey. They 
became the parents of seven children, one now living. S. L. The late Dr. D. 
P. Pancoast, who died November 5. 1899, \\as a resident of Mullica Hill. 
The father died in 1870 and the mother was called to her final rest in 1880. 

S. L. Pancoast attended the local schools at Mullica Hill, where his entire 
life has been passed, for he was born in the house which is now his home, his 
natal day being December 28, 1830. He also pursued his studies in Wilming- 
ton. Delaware, and then entered upon his business career at Mullica Hill in 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEJl' JERSEY. 399 

a mercantile establishment. In 1853 he went to Philadelphia, where he re- 
mained until 1862. when he returned to Mullica Hill and embarked in mer- 
chandising. He successfully conducted a store until April, 1897, when he 
resigned. He now deals in lumber, coal and farmers' supplies, and is enjoy- 
ing a liberal patronage, w'hich has come to him as the result of his enterprise 
and honorable business methods. 

Mr. Pancoast is a prominent citizen of New Jersey and has been espe- 
cially active in political circles. He is a stanch advocate of the Republican 
party and was first called to office in 1852, when he was chosen the township 
collector for a two-years term. Later he was the township committeeman, 
and in 1883 was elected to the state senate to fill out an unexpired term. He 
was afterward chosen for the full term of three years, and was a very active, 
influential and capable member of the upper house. He has given his sup- 
port to all local measures advanced for the public good, has aided in securing 
railroads and other improvements, and is a most progressive and valued citi- 
zen. He is serving as a vestr\man of the Episcopal church and is a man of 
high standing in the community, respected by all with whom he has been 
brought in contact. 



\VILLI.\M S. HARKER. 

The fitting reward of a well spent, u]3right business career is an honored 
retirement from labor that one ma)- enjoy its fruits in after years. For 
thirty years Mr. Harker was a worthy representative of the wholesale inter- 
ests of Philadelphia, but has now put aside business cares and is passing the 
evening of his life at his pleasant home at Mullica Hill. The prosperity that 
rewards earnest efifort is his. and his life history stands in- exemplification of 
the truth that success is not a matter of genius but is the outcome of con- 
tinuous labor guided by sound judgment. 

Mr. Harker is a native of the town in which he makes his home. His 
father, Joseph Harker. was born in Swedesboro and was a son of Joseph 
Harker. Sr. The former engaged in merchandising, carrying on the leading 
business at Mullica Hill. He was also a lumber merchant at this place and 
w^as accounted one of its most enterprising, influential and prominent citi- 
zens. He was honored by election to public office, being chosen the repre- 
sentative of his district in the state legislature. His death occurred in i860. 
His wife, who bore the maiden name of Alice Horner, is a daughter of Elijah 
Homer and is still living, at the advanced age of seventy-nine years. By

lier marriage she became the mother of six children, two of whom survive. 
W. S. and Emma, the latter the wife of I. O. Acton, of Salem. 

Our subject pursued his education in the Mullica Hill Academy, and 
throughout his business career was identified with mercantile interests in 
Philadelphia, being for thirt\- years the owner of an extensive wholesale 
notion house in that cit}-. His trade extended over a w'ide area and his 
liberal patronage t)rought to him a handsome income. In 1893 he disposed 
of his business and has since lived retired in Mullica Hill, his former success 
enabling him to secure all the comforts and many of the luxuries of life. 

Mr. Harker is a life member of Crescejit Lodge. Xo. 493. F. & .\. M.. of 
Philadelphia, in which he has held a numl)er of offices. His life has been 
passed in the faithful discharge of all duties that have devolved upon him 
and his sterling worth commends him to the confidence of those with whom 
he has been associated. He started out in life in a humble position, steadily 
worked his way upward until he occupies a commanding place in trade cir- 
cles and to-day he is enjo\Mng the comforts that well earned wealth can 
secure. 



GEORGE \V. SMITH. 



Tales of heroism ha\-e Ijeen the theme of song and story since the earliest 
ages and deeds of valor will ne\er fail to awaken the admiration of all. The 
pages of history are illumined by the record of those who upon bloodv battle- 
fields have fought for their countr\- and the debt of gratitude which a nation 
owes its brave soldiers can never be repaid. Every writer delights in mak- 
ing his hero a bra\-e man. and even the biographer, who confines himself to 
fact and does not let his fancy stray into the realms of fiction, finds satisfac- 
tion in recounting the history of one whose loyalty and patriotism have been 
manifested upon the field of battle. It is therefore with pleasure that we 
undertake the task of preparing the life record of Colonel George \V. Smith, 
whcj in response to the country's call for troops in 1861 offered his services 
to the go\ernment and followed the stars and stripes until the wounds sus- 
tained in active engagements forced him to put aside the old uniform w hicb 
was the badge of his loyalty to the Union. 

Colonel Smith was liorn in Cincinnati, Februar}- 22. 1828, a son of 
Thomas and Sophia (Bigham) Smith. The ancestor of the family to which 
he belongs came to America with Eord FSaltimore and aided in founding the 
colony of Maryland. There the paternal great-grandfather made his home, 
living to an advanced age. Thomas Smith, the grandfather, resided on the 
eastern shore of ^laryland and served throughout the Revolutionary war. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NBIF JERSEY. 401 

holding official rank. He was also an officer in the war of 1812. He was 
extensively engaged in farming throughout his business career and lived to 
the advanced age of one hundred and four years. The family is noted for 
longevity, several of its representatives having been centenarians. 

Thomas Smith, the father of Colonel Smith, was born on the eastern 
shore of Maryland, and was a comb manufacturer, carrying on business in 
that line until his death, which occurred in Cincinnati, in 1832, as the result 
of an attack of cholera. He conducted an extensive enterprise for that day 
and was a man of considerable means. His wife died in 1848, at the age of 
forty-five years. In his family were three sons, and the characteristic bravery 
and loyalty of the family were shown by their service in the Union army. 
William H., the eldest, was a carpenter and resided in Philadelphia and at 
Cape May. After the inauguration of hostilities between the north and the 
south, he joined Company B, One Hundred and Sixth Pennsylvania Infantry, 
and participated in all the engagements of the Army of the Potomac up to 
and including the battle of Gettysburg, on the 3d of July, 1863, when he was 
killed. He fell pierced by fi\-e bullets, and thus another noble life was sacri- 
ficed that the Union might stand. He had been promoted to the rank of 
lieutenant and in many engagements had manifested marked valor. His 
wife was Fannie, daughter of John C. Little, and they had one son. William 
H.. who married Miss Pierson. George W. was the second of the family. 
James T., the youngest, a cigar manufacturer and painter, residing in Cape 
May, enlisted September 15, 1861, in Company A. Seventh Regiment, New 
Jersey Volunteers, which served with the Army of the Potomac in the Second 
Jersey Brigade. James T. Smith was in the recruiting service, but also par- 
ticipated in the seven-days battle and the campaign under Grant, and was 
badly wounded in the hip at the storming of Petersburg. 

After his father's death, which occurred during the early boyhood of Col- 
onel Smith, of this review, the latter, together with the other members of the 
family, removed to Philadelphia, and he was educated in the common schools 
of Montgomerv county, Pennsylvania, pursuing his studies in one of the old- 
time log school-houses, with its slab seats, puncheon floor and primitive fur- 
nishings. He afterward went to Philadelphia, where he learned the brush- 
maker's trade, but never followed that occupation. Instead he took up the 
painter's trade, and in May, 1850. removed to Cape Alay, where he engaged 
in painting until the breaking out of the war, when he put aside all personal 
considerations to aid in defense of the Union. On the 17th of June, 1861. 
he became first lieutenant of the Cape ^lay Island Home Guards, and imme- 
diately volunteered in the Seventh New Jersey Regiment, becoming a mem- 
ber of Companv A. He was made orderly sergeant on the 15th of Septem-

ber of that year, and for three years served in tlie Army of tlie Potomac. ]iar- 
ticipating in the engagements at Fair Oaks and the seven-days battles, and 
at this time was the sergeant major of the regiment. He had command of 
the regiment, for it had lost all its commissioned officers in former battles. 
For this he was recommended for his first commission as second lieutenant. 
He was also engaged at the battle of Malvern Hill, where the loss was very 
heavy, but he brought the remnant to Harrison's Landing. Only two hun- 
dred and fifty of the entire number were ready for duty after those engage- 
ments. Mr. Smith was there taken ill and it was believed could never re- 
cover, but eventually he regained his health and rejoined his regiment at 
Alexandria, Virginia, where he was promoted second lieutenant in recogni- 
tion of his meritorious conduct on the battle-field at Malvern Hill. He par- 
ticipated in the battle of Fredericksburg, where he was injured by spraining 
his spine, which has resulted in spinal disease. He was then promoted to 
the rank of first lieutenant. At the battle of Chancellorsville his regiment 
captured five stands of colors. There he was again promoted, being made 
the captain of Company A. He was also wounded there, a ball striking him 
in the chin, piercing his tongue, and coming through the trachea. On ac- 
count of disability thus occasioned he was honorably discharged and returned 
home, and for three years thereafter he was unfit for active work. 

When the war broke out he was an alderman of Cape May. He came 
home in January. 1864, and in March of the same year was again elected to 
the city council. As soon as able he resumed work at the painter's trade, and 
carried on business along that line until 1880, when he embarked in business 
as a dealer in house-furnishmg goods. He was also the postmaster at 
Avalon, where he resided for five years, after which he removed to Camden, 
where he conducted a grocery until the injury which he sustained in the civil 
war made further labor impossible, and he returned to Cape l\Iay, where he 
has since lived retired. 

Colonel Smith has never failed to feel a deep interest in military affairs 
and organizations. In the year 1871-2 he was the sergeant-at-arms in the 
New Jersey senate, and in 1875 he organized Company H, of the Sixth New 
Jersey National Guard, became its first captain, was made the major of the 
regiment in 1882, and was elected lieutenant-colonel, October 11. 1885, occu- 
pying the latter position until March, 1887, when he resigned on account of 
failing health. Before us as we write lies a paper called the Cape May Counts- 
Ocean Wave, which was published in Cape May and bears the date of July 
24, 1862. In it is an account of Colonel Smith's promotion during the cixil 
war. It says: "Mr. Smith received his commission as second lieutenant on 
the 8th inst., but his promotion from June 14th. We are pleasefl with this 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEJ]' JIiRSEY. 403 

promotion, as friend Smitli lias l)een a good, faitliful officer, and he was de- 
serving of this advancement. Wlien the Seventli left Trenton he was orderly 
sergeant of Company A, afterward he was promoted to sergeant-major of the 
regiment, which is a position of honor rather than pay, and now he has been 
made lieutenant. Some time since he received a sword, worth thirty-five 
dollars, with the following w^ords inscribed upon it: "Presented to Sergeant- 
Major George W. Smith, by his captain, Louis R. Francine." " Colonel 
Smith is now an esteemed and valued member of John Mecray Post. No. 40, 
G. A. R., at Cape May, has filled various offices and is now chaplain of the 
post. 

On the 2d of June, 1852, Colonel Smith was united in marriage to Miss 
Ann E. Little, a daughter of John C. Little, of Philadelphia, and to them 
were born the following children: Blanche S.. who became the wife of 
Charles Williams, a plasterer, who died a year later; Fannie V., the wife of 
Charles Lang, a broker of Philadelphia, In- whom she has three children, — 
Marguerite. Philip Rice and Charles H.; Sallie, at home; Annie E., the 
wife of Samuel H. Moore, the station agent of the West Jersey Railroad 
Company at Cape May, by whom she has a daughter. Helen G. : Jennie Y., 
the wife of John C. Little, a painter and the proprietor of the Stockton bath- 
houses at Cape May, by whom she has two sons, — Albert and George W.; 
Walter R.. who is engaged in the 1)ic}cle business at Cape May; George B. 
W.. superintendent of the Miirphey file works at Camden. New Jersey, who 
married Violet Newcomb. and has a son. Daniel D. B.; George W., who died 
at the age of five years ; and Charles, who died at the age of one year. The 
mother of these children died in 1878, at 'the age of forty-eight years, and 
Colonel Smith was again married April 3, 1879, his second union being with 
Ester G., a daughter of James C. Fithian and Catherine (Grumm) Fithian. 
Her father w-as born in Philadelphia, l^ut li\ed in New York. He was the 
owner of a vessel and died at sea, of yellow ie\-er. .\11 of the family have 
also passed away. 

In his political views Colonel Smith is a stanch Republican and has served 
as a member of the board of health of Cape May for several years. He has 
long been A leading and influential member in the Methodist Episcopal 
church, was the superintendent of the Sunday-school for twenty-five years, 
besides five years spent in A\alon, and for a quarter of a centur_\- he was a 
member of the choir. He has always taken a deep and active interest in the 
work of the church and his upright life is in harmony with his professions. 
He is as true to all his duties of private life to-day as when he followed the 
stars and stripes upon the battle-fields of the south. 



404 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

JAMES M. E. HILDRETH. 

In buth political and business circles Mr. Hildreth is known throughout 
New Jersc}-. His has been a career commendable for its fidelity to duty in 
all life's relations, and while he has been honored by his fellow men with 
public office he has also honored the state and district which he represented. 
In business he is the soul of honor and integrity, in social circles he is affable 
and courteous, and his whole career has been permeated by a kindliness and 
sympathy that have arisen from a personal interest in his fellow men. 

Mr. Hildreth was born in Cape Ma)-, December 9, 1859, and was a son 
of Alvin P. and Lydia (Wales) Hildreth. The paternal grandfather, George 
Hildreth, resided at Cold Spring, New Jersey, and was a pilot on the Dela- 
ware ri\er. His political support was given to the Democracy and he served 
his township in \arious local offices. In religious belief he was a Presb}'- 
terian, was \ery active in the work of the church and did all in his power to 
uplift humanity and better the conditions of human life. He had four chil- 
dren. — Alvin P., Eliza E., Daniel and Jane. The daughter, Eliza E., became 
the wife of Lafayette Miller. 

Hon. Alvin P. Hildreth, the father of our subject, was born at Cold 
Spring, and in early life engaged in teaching school. He completed his edu- 
cation within the classic walls of Yale College and was a man of strong in- 
dividuality and marked intellectuality, who in public life was frequently called 
to positions of prominence and trust. For some time he engaged in the hotel 
business in Cape May, was afterward proprietor of the Metropolitan Hotel in 
Washington, D. C, and subsequently returned to Cape May, where he con- 
ducted one of the leading hotels in this section of the state. Prompt, ener- 
getic and thoroughly reliable, his reputation in business circles is indeed 
enviable, and he had the happy faculty of winning warm friendships. A 
recognized leader in Democratic circles, he was at one time a member of the 
riparian commission of New Jersey and was twice elected to represent his 
district in the general assembly of the state. In local affairs he exercised 
marked influence, and his co-operation was always given to movements and 
measures calculated to advance the progress and welfare of the community. 
His Masonic relations were with Cape Island Lodge, of which he was a 
valued member. He married Lydia Wales, a representative of one of the 
distinguished families of New Jersey. Her uncle, Hon. E. L. B. \^'ale5, 
was at one time a judge of the New Jersey court of errors and appeals, the 
highest tribunal in the state, and others of the family occupied eminent posi- 
tions in public life. Mr. and Mrs. Hildreth became the parents of four chil- 
dren, — Howard, Frank H., James ^I. E. and Alvin. The father died in .\u- 





}h(^^ 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF .V£/f JERSEY. 405 

gust, 1898, at the age of fifty-six years, and the mother passed away in Janu- 
ary, 1862, at the early age of twenty-eight years. 

James M. E. Hildreth spent the first twelve years of his life in his native 
city and was then taken to Mount Holly, where he completed his education 
in the Mount Holly Academy, an excellent institution. Determining to enter 
the legal profession he became a student in the law oftice of Hon. Walter A. 
Barrows, his uncle, and also studied under the direction of Hon. Joseph H. 
Gaskell, now the president judge of ijurlington county. He diligently ap- 
plied himself to the task of mastering the principles of jurisprudence and after 
careful preparation was admitted to practice in the courts of New Jersey in 
1 88 1. He then returned to his native citv, where his law business has steadily 
increased, and he now has an extensive and distinctly representative clientage. 
His devotion to his clients is proverbial, yet it is said that he never advised 
any one to enter into litigation except to right a wrong. He is an indefati- 
gable and earnest worker, and the litigation with which he has been con- 
nected has been of a very important character. His practice has Ijeen general 
and he is proficient in every department of the law: and, w-ith his keenly 
analytical mind, his broad knowledge of the principles of jurisprudence has 
enabled him to apply to the ])oint in controversy the law which bears most 
closely upon it, citing authority and precedent until the strength of his case 
is clearly seen by judge and jurw His deductions are logical anil the force 
of his arguments is shown in the man\- verdicts favorable to his clients which 
he has won. He is also interested in real estate in Cape May, where he owns 
valuable property. He was instrumental in organizing the Franklin Electric 
Light Company of this city in 1886 and has since been its general manager. 
He is a director of the New Jersey Trust and Safe Deposit Company: also a 
director in the South Jersey Railway Company, which opened a competing 
line to Cape May in 1894. All enterprising movements receive his encour- 
agement, and his sul)Stantial aid is given to matters and measures for the 
public good. As to the fraternal orders, he is a Afason, Heptasoph. Work- 
man and Redman. 

His political prominence is the result of eminent fitness for leadership 
and the abilitv which he has sliown in the discharge of the duties entrusted 
to him. In 18S3 he was chosen by the city council for the oftice of solicitor 
and won the highest commendation of all by the manner in which he per- 
formed the duties that devolved upon him. In March, 1893, he was chosen as 
the chief executive of the city and in that year he was instrumental in hold- 
ing a Fourth-of-July celebration which will ever be memorable in the history 
of the city. Benjamin Harrison, ex-president of the United States, was the 
distinguished guest and principal S]jeaker on that occasion, and Mr. Hildreth 



4o6 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE TIRST 

introduced Mr. Harrison and presided o\-er the ceremonies in a manner that 
elicited the warmest praise of liis fellow townsmen. Marked improvement 
was made in the city in many lines during the mayoralty of Mr. Hildreth. and 
yet so economical was the management of the business affairs of Cape ^lay 
that each taxpayer was saved fourteen per cent of the usual net amount of 
his tax. In 1895 the city council again elected Mr. Hildreth to the ofifice of 
city solicitor and in 1897 he was elected the mayor. To those who are ac- 
quainted with the man it is needless to say that his administration was pro- 
gressi\-e and beneficial. In 1898 he was a prominent candidate for congres- 
sional honors in the first district, and though he did not seek the nomination 
he received the most flattering vote of eighty-one ballots. He is now promi- 
nently spoken of by his friends as a candidate for congress in 1900. He is 
an earnest champion of the principles of the Republican party, and though 
he has held local positions he is by no means a politician in the commonly 
accepted sense of an oflfice-seeker. He has been a close student of govern- 
mental problems and he ever places the welfare of the state and nation be- 
fore personal aggranrlizement. Mr. Hildreth is an active member of the 
Cape May City Athletic Club, which was organized August 15, 1887, and 
as a member of its directorate he was associated with some of the most 
eminent and distinguished citizens of Philadelphia and Cape May. He was 
elected to the ofifice of secretary and attorney and lias been a prominent fac- 
tor in the successful conduct of the afYairs of the club. This club organized 
and fostered the once famous Cape May Base Ball Club, which brought such 
prominence to this city. 

On the 1 2th of Xoxember, 1884, Mr. Hildreth was imited in marriage to 
Miss Mattie O. Mecray. a daughter of Jeremiah Mecray. and they now have 
one daughter. Man- M. The parents are members of the Presbyterian 
church and since January. 1885, Mr. Hildreth has served as trustee and treas- 
urer of the church. He is a representative American citizen, energetic in 
business, courteous in social life and loyal to his duties of citizenship and to 
his native land. Though one of the busiest of men he always has a smile of 
welcome for all. graciously giving his time to those who ask it and thereby 
constantlv adding to his long list of friends. 



WALTER S. LEAMING. M. D.. D. D. S. 

Among the ])rominent men of the state of New Jerscx', none occupy a 
position of relativeh' greater importance in the community in. which the\' 
reside than Dr. W. S. Leaming. who was formerlv state senator from his 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEIf JERSEY. 407 

district and is now serving as the city treasurer of Cape May. The common 
opinion has for some time been that American pohtics were probably never 
so corrupt as at the present day. that the affairs of the country are in the 
hands of professional politicians who are working for their own interests and 
not for the good of the majority, and it is sucli men as the one whose name 
heads this record that restores the public confidence and renews the faith 
that we shall have wise legislation and just laws brought about by honoralile 
men with pure political records and devoted to their country's interests and 
not to their own aggrandizement. 

The Doctor was born in Cape May county. March 4, 1854. his parents 
being Jonathan F. and Eliza H. (Bennett) Learning. He pursued his educa- 
tion in the Mayville Academy and in the high school of New York city, and 
on the completion of his literary course began preparation for a professional 
career as a student in the Pennsylvania Dental College, in which he was 
graduated in the class of 1876. He is also a graduate of the Jefiferson Medi- 
cal College, in Philadelphia, of the class of 1882. In the Centennial year he 
opened an office in Cape May Court House, where he still maintains his den- 
tal pariors. although he has made his home in the city of Cape May since 
1889. He enjoys a liberal patronage, by reason of his superior skill and 
ability, and has a fine office, equipped with the latest improved instruments 
and equipments for the successful conduct of a dental practice. 

While Dr. Leaming has gained prestige in his chosen calling, however, 
he is probably more widely known in connection with his public service. He 
has always been a close student of the pohtical questions and issues of the 
day, and before he had attained legal age the nomination for state senator 
was tendered him. He was a member of the lower house of the assembly in 
1877, and from 1888 until 1890 served in the senate and in the latter year re- 
ceived the vote of his party for president of the senate, and lacked only one 
vote of being elected. He was a recognized leader in Republican ranks and 
his influence was very marked. He has ser\^ed for three years as the presi- 
dent of the city council of Cape May, and in 1899 was elected the treasurer 
of the city, which position he is now acceptably filling. He has long been 
recognized as an important factor in political circles, and his patriotic spirit 
has been manifest in his loyal support of many measures for the general 
good. 

With various business, social and moral interests. Dr. Leaming has also 
Ijeen identified. He was at one time a member of the board of trade and is 
a member and director of the ^Mechanics & Laborers" Building & Loan Asso- 
ciation, at Cape Mav Court House. He holds membership in the Ancient 
Order of United Workmen and the Improved Order of Heptasophs. and is 



4o8 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

an active and zealous member of the Baptist church, in which he is now serv- 
ing as a deacon. The school system finds in him a stanch advocate, and he 
did effective service in its interest while serving as a member of the board 
of education of Cape May Court House. 

The Doctor has been twice married. He first wedded Mary H. Holmes, 
a daughter of Judge Richard Holmes, the judge of the court of common 
pleas of Cape May county. On the 30th of November. 1878, Mrs. Leaming 
died, at the age of twenty-four years, leaving a daughter, named Nellie. For 
his second wife the Doctor chose Miss Rebecca H., a daughter of \\'illiam 
J. Bennett, a pilot of Cape May. Their wedding was celebrated December 
22, 1889, and has been blessed with two children, Rebecca and Henrietta. 
To the Doctor and his wife is extended the hospitality of the best homes in 
Cape May, and they occupy an enviable position in social circles. He in- 
spires strong personal friendships and has the happy faculty of drawing his 
friends closer to him as the years pass by. 



TAME.S M. ROE. 



A retired farmer residing in Paulsboro, J. M. Roe was born in \\'ood- 
bury, Gloucester count}', March 14, 1821, and is descended from good old 
Revolutionary stock. The family is of Scotch lineage and was founded in 
the New World in colonial days. Henry Roe, the grandfather of our sub- 
ject, was born in Gloucester county, and when the oppression of England 
brought on the war of the Revolution he loyally aided in the struggle for 
independence. His son Robert, the father of our subject, was born in Wood- 
bury and became a hat manufacturer of his native town, where he carried on 
business for a number of years. His last days, however, were passed in 
Mount Ephraim, where his death occurred. He married Ann Hurley, a 
daughter of James Hurley, of Camden county, and she has also passed away. 
In their family were five children, but onlv two are now living, — Miriam and 
J. M. 

The latter pursued his education in the public schools of Woodbury and 
subsequently engaged in teaching. In March, 1845, he removed to Green- 
wich township and for many years devoted his energies to farming, his well 
directed efforts bringing to him a comfortable competence. He yet owns 
seventy-five acres of land, which he rents. His business affairs have ever 
claimed his close attention and his diligence and capable management 
brought him a well deserved success. He was the soul of honor in all trade 
transactions and demanded that others should treat him as fairly as he treated 
them. 



COXGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF XEIV JERSEY. 409 

For many years Mr. Roe has been prominently connected with the pubhc 
interests, having for fifteen years served as justice of the peace, while for 
some time he was the collector of his township and settled many estates. In 
1856 he was chosen freeholder, filling that position for three years. 

On the 30th of December, 1846, Mr. Roe married Miss Lydia A. Miller, 
of Greenwich township. They have four children: Anna, the wife of I. G. 
Cox, a resident of Paulsboroj Elizabeth, the wife of George C. Laws, also of 
Paulsboro; Emily; and Susan M., the wife of J. A. Reinhart, of Paterson, 
New Jersey. The father of these children was a member of the Odd Fellows' 
society. He has now passed the Psalmist's span of three-score years and ten 
and has put aside the more arduous duties and cares of life, resting in the 
enjoyment of the fruits of his former toil. His life has been well spent and all 
who know him admire and respect him for his genuine worth. 



GEORGE R. RICHARDSON. 

On a farm in Logan township, Gloucester county, resides George R, 
Richardson, who is accounted one of the leading agriculturists of this com- 
munitv. He was born in New Castle county, Delaware, on the 21st of Feb- 
ruary-, 1832, and is a son of Carmen and Maria (Riday) Richardson, the for- 
mer a native of New Jersey and the latter of Pennsylvania. They were of 
English and German descent respectively, and in 1834 the father removed- 
with his family to Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, where he died in 1863, at the 
age of fifty-six years. His wife, long surviving him, passed away in 1882, at 
the age of eighty-five years. Their children were Mary Ann, wife of Albert 
Sutton, of Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania; George R.; Carmen, who died in 
Virginia, when about sixty years of age; John, who died at Marcus Hook, 
when fifty-eight years of age; and one or two children who died in infancy. 

The educational privileges which were afforded to Mr. Richardson were 
quite limited. During his early youth he attended school for about three 
months in the year, but when very young became connected with the oyster 
fisheries and was thus engaged for fifteen years. Since 1856 he has occupied 
his present farm, which is a portion of the John D. Norton estate and is lo- 
cated in the section of the township known as Nortonville. He prosecutes 
his labors with diligence and his efforts bring to him a good financial return. 
On the 29th of September, 1853, Mr. Richardson was united in marriage 
to Miss Sarah Jane Norton, a daughter of John D. Norton, of Logan town- 
ship. She died June 15, 1898, at the age of sixty-five years, and many 
friends throughout the communitv mourned her loss. In their family were

and who married Lidia McCullough, a daughter of William McCullough. of 
Swedesboro, by whom he has two children, — -Howard H. and Sarah M. 

Mr. Richardson exercises his right of franchise in support of the men and 
measures of the Republican party, and he and his family are members of 
Center Square Methodist Episcopal church. His life has been an honorable 
and upright one, characterized by earnest devotion to all the duties of citizen- 
ship, and wherever he is known he has won the confidence and good will of 
those whom he has met. 



ARTHUR H. TOWNSEXD. 

Arthur Harrison Townsend, a respected resident of Millville, wears worth- 
ily the honored familv name of his ancestors, who for manv generations have 
resided in this country, the family having been founded here in colonial 
days. The Townsend motto is "Haec generi inceremento fides." — Ennobled 
for their fidelity. A coat of arms that was brought to this country about 
1700 is now in possession of Miss R. P. Townsend. The Townshends and 
Townsends are all descended from the same original stock. Thomas Town- 
send, the original American emigrant, sailed from London to Boston and 
took up his residence in Lynn county. Massachusetts, in 1635. He was a son 
of Henr}' Townsend and the grandson of Sir Robert Townsend, the second 
son of another Sir Robert. The Townsends are of mixed Saxon and Norman 
lineage, and the family is one of great antiquity in the county of Norfolk, 
England. Jonathan Townsend. one of the ancestors of our subject in the 
direct line, married Huldah Newton, and they had seven children, — ^Jona- 
than, Martin, Sallie, Benjamin, Nancy. Polly and Elizabeth, all of whom 
were bom in New Salem, Massachusetts. After the death of the father the 
mother married Daniel Curtis, and had a daughter by her second marriage.

' Jonathan Townsend, the grandfather of our subject, was born in Broom 
county. Canada, on the 14th of August, 1820, and was a son of Eliphalet 
Townsend, who was a shoemaker b>- trade, and is now living retired in Hyde 
Park. Vermont. His life has been a quiet and unassuming one, and though 
he has sought not notoriety he has won the respect of his fellow men. .\ 
zealous member of the Seventh-Day Adventists' church, he is a great Bible 
student and a conscientious Christian man. He married Elizabeth French, 
and they had seven children: George R.: Anna T.. who was born March 20. 
1843, and died Mav 3. 1843; Mary A., who was born March 19. 1844; Elmira, 
who was born March 24, 1846, and died January 28, 1847; Arthur H.. born 
November 20. 1847; Isadora M., born June i. 1849: and Cecelia A., born 
August 28. 185 1. During the civil war .\rthur H. Townsend, of this family, 
enlisted in the Union army, in 1863, was captured by the rebels in September. 
1864, and died in the prison at Salisbury. North Carolina, on the 22d of No- 
vember of the same year. 

George Riley Townsend, the father of our subject, was born in Broom 
county. Canada,' August 17, 1841, and when twenty years of age responded 
to his' country's call for troops, enlisting, in 1861. in the Seventh Regiment 
of Vermont Volunteers, which was assigned to the Department of the Gulf 
and operated in Florida and Louisiana. He liecame a private detective and 
spy in the service of General Asbeth. and was severely wounded in a skirmish 
by a bavonet which was thrown at him and pierced his hand. Drawing the 
weapon he threw it at the owner, killing him. On numerous occasions he 
distinguished himself by coolness and daring, and at all times his service 
was most commendable. At one time a certain captain was wont to ignore 
the regulation of giving the countersign, and Mr. Townsend warned him 
that he would shoot his mule from under him if he again disobeyed the re- 
quirement. Not long afterward the demand was again violated by the cap- 
tain, who attempted to dash by Mr. Townsend, but the latter shot and killed 
his mule. It is probable that after that he had no more trouble with the 
officer. After the war he was married to Francelia D. Ober. and to them 
were liorn five children, namely: .\rthur H., who is the eldest of the family; 
Grace R.. who was born November 28. 1868, and married Bertram S. Ward, 
by whom she had three children, — Frank E., born October i, 1887: Minnie 
E., born July 2, 1889: and .\rthur W., born January 26, i89i,and died young; 
Nettie, born October 9, 1869. was married November 4, 1893, to William 
Emerson; Myrtle I., born December 20, 1874, was married November 30, 
1893. to Olin V. Baily; and Maud E.. born May (>. 1877. was married July 9.

Arthur Harrison Townsend, whose name introduces this review, was ])orn 



412 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

February 24, 1867, in Johnson, Lamoille county, Vermont. In early life he 
left home to make his own way in the world, and whatever success he has 
achieved is the result of his own efforts. When twenty-six )ears of age he 
established the Mountain Mirror, at Lake Placid, New York, continuing- its 
publication for some time. Subsequently he was connected with the Bridge- 
ton Pioneer for two or three years, and afterward became a reporter on the 
^lillville Republican, as well as the advertising manager. A vear later he was 
made the general manager and editor of the Millville Republican and Daily 
Reporter. The paper known as the Millville Republican was established in 
1864, and the Daily Reporter, in 1897; and in 1899 these were consolidated 
under the name of the Millville Republican & Daily Reporter, as an inde- 
pendent Republican journal. Under the capable management of Mr. To\\n- 
send this paper has proved a profitable investment. When he assumed charge 
its business was being carried on at a loss of seventy-five dollars per week, 
but he soon placed it upon a paying basis and the business is now profitable 
and is constantly increasing. The daily paper has a circulation of one thou- 
sand copies; and the weekly, which is issued every Friday, has a circulation 
of seventeen hundred copies. A large job printing business is also carried 
on. The paper is a neat and well edited journal, devoted largely to local in- 
terests and to the promotion of the various enterprises and movements which 
contribute to the progress of the city along material, social, educational and 
moral lines. 

Mr. Townsend is also the president of the Millville Board of Trade, and 
was largely instrumental in its organization, issuing the announcement which 
called the meeting for this purpose in March. 1899. The board has been very 
successful in its work, owing largely to the efforts of Mr. Townsend. It has 
been effective in securing the continuation of important industries in Mill- 
ville and of establishing others at this point. Mr. Townsend is also the local 
secretary and treasurer of the Mutual Building Loan Bank, of Camden. He 
is the president of the Cumberland County Wheelmen and labored earnestly 
and with result in securing the new bicycle jiath, which was built from Cum- 
berland to Hunter's Mill, thus shortening the route from Philadelphia to the 
sea by twenty miles. 

Socially Mr. Townsend is connected with the Improved Order of Red 
]\Ien, of whom he was chief of the records three years; with the Independent 
Order of Odd Fellows and the Knights of the Mystic Chain. For se\eral 
years he has taken an active interest in musical matters in the city, lieing 
quite proficient in both instrumental and vocal music. He has been a mem- 
ber of the choir of the First Presbyterian church. 

On the 6th of January, 1891, Mr. Townsend was married to Flora Ella

Seo-ua, and to them were born two children: Ida li^y. who was born Sep- 
tember 22, 1892, and died in September. 1899; and George Arthur, who died 
in early childhood. Mr. and Mrs. Townsend occupy leading positions in 
social circles and enjoy the warm regard of many friends. His courteous and 
genial manner has made him very popular, and he well deserves representa- 
tion in the history of his adopted county.

TOSH C A :\IOORE. 



Joshua ]\loore was born in Salem count v. New Jersey. October 20. 1843. 
a son of Allen and Sarah (Dean) Moore. Here several generations of the 
family had been born before him. The name Moore is said to have origin- 
ated as a surname in a highland clan of Scotland and to ha\e been an expres- 
sion of the idea of greatness in prowess and reprisal. Down through the 
times of the Covenanters and the scenes in which popery was dealt telling 
blows, which have become historic, men of the name were prominent, always 
in the van of Protestantism. During the memorable difficulties of the days 
of James H of England, \'II of Scotland, Jacob Moore, a native of the North 
of Ireland, had trouble in his home country, and early in the eighteenth cen- 
tury, not many years after the death of the king, which occurred in 1701, he 
emigrated to America and settled on Long Island. From there he came to 
New Jersey, locating in the North Cohansey precinct, within the present 
boundaries of Cumberland county, w here he soon married Abigail Peck and 
in due time bought a tract of land, a part of the \Vasse survey, it is lielieved. 
from Daniel Cox of Burlington. This land is at the head of Beetle run and 
on the north sitle of that stream which empties into the lower branch of Stoe 
creek. After the organization of Cumberland county Jacob Moore's home- 
stead was in Hopewell township. In 1738 he built a large log dwelling on 
this land.

Hannah, of Salem, New Jersey. Joseph died in 1800, after having been for a 
number of years a ruling elder in the Deerfield church. Azariah was a weaver 
and by good business methods gained a substantial position financially. He 
was an ardent Whig and after the struggle for American independence began 
enlisted and served as a soldier in the Revolutionary army. He was a very 
methodical man. of excellent character and judgment, and served long as 
justice of the peace. His charity was practical and unceasing. He never

Shiloh, was presided over by his sister Martha. He lies in the old Presby- 
terian churchyard at Greenwich. 

John Moore, a son of Jacob and Abigail (Peck) Moore, died February 
22, 1800. He also fought for liberty in the patriot army of America. He 
settled half a mile east of his brother Azariah and married Rachel Moore, of 
a family of Moores not closely related to his own, and had eleven children, 
eight of whom were reared to manhood and womanhood and five of whom 
left descendants. Four of these descendants, all great-grandsons of John 
Moore, volunteered in the military service of the United States in the war of 
the rebellion, — one from Pennsylvania died in the service, one from Ohio, 
one from Iowa, and another, John Moore Tyler, from Cumberland county, 
New Jersey. The last mentioned also gave up his life for his country.

eral important offices were thrust upon him by his fellow-citizens, who had 
the most implicit faith in his integrity and ability. He was a freeholder, a 
member of the state legislature, chairman of the board of trustees of the alms- 
house board, and long an influential member of the executive committee of 
his township; and from time to time he also fulfilled other responsible 
trusts. He married Sarah, the daughter of Alexander Dean, a nati\e of

to Philadelphia and learned the trade of paper-hanger. In 1874 he returned 
to New Jersey and located at Woodstown, where he entered upon a business

J. HAMPTON FITHIAN. 

The history of few families can be traced back in a more direct line or in 
a more correct manner than that of the Fithian family, of which our subject 
is a representative. Prior to the year 1640 William Fithian, a native of 
England, came to America, crossing the Atlantic with the colony that settled 
in Lynn, Massachusetts. The name was sometimes spelled Pythian, but the 
present orthography has always been followed by the branch of the family to 
which J. Hampton Fithian belongs. The original American ancestor. Wil- 
liam Fithian removed from Massachusetts to East Hampton, on Long Island, 
where he died about the year 1680. His last will and testament was dated De- 
cember II, 1678. His children were: Enoch, Samuel, Sarah, Hannah and 
Martha. The Cumberland county branch of the family is descended from 
Samuel Fithian, but many of the name are still found at East Hampton. 

Samuel Fithian was married March 6, 1679, to Priscilla, daughter of 
Thomas and Alary Burnet, of South Hampton, Long Island. Their children 
were: John, who was bom September i, 1681; Josiah, born May 6. 1685: 
Samuel, born April 17, 1688; Esther, born March 6, 1691; Mathias, born 
February 3, 1694; and William, born March 25, 1698. Samuel Fithian, with 
his wife and children, removed from East Hampton, Long Island, to Fairfield. 
Cumberland county, New Jersey, between the years 1698 and 1702, locating 
at what is now called New England Roads. 

The eldest son, John Fithian, there married and had a daughter, Priscilla. 
who was born May i, 1702. He died prior to her birth, and in 1704 his widow 
married John Ogden. 

Josiah Fithian, the second son of Samuel and Priscilla Fithian, located at 
Greenwich. Cumberland county. New Jersey, upon a farm, about 1706. He 
owned extensive tracts of land and carried on agricultural pursuits on a large 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEJF JERSEY. 419 

scale. He also was called upon to settle up many estates and frequently acted 
as attorney in securing adjustment of troubles between jaeople of the com- 
munity. He married Sarah Dennis, and their children were: John, who 
was born in 1709: Jeremiah, born in 171,3: Samuel, born in 1715: Hannah, 
born in 1718: Esther, born in 1721; Joseph, born in 1724: Sarah, bom in 
1726: and Josiah, born in 1728. After the death of the mother the father 
married again, but had no children by the second union. He was a promi- 
nent member and an elder in the Presbyterian church, and laid the corner 
stone in its house of worship in Greenwich in 1735. He was recognized as a 
leader in public afifairs in many ways, and exerted a wide influence in matters 
pertaining to the general progress. He served as one of the judges of the 
county of Salem in 1732-3 and from 1738 to 1740. inclusive. His death oc- 
curred April 3. 1741. and his first wife passed away in 1732. 

Samuel Fithian, the great-great-great-grandfather of our subject, was 
born October 12. 1715. and died November 2. 1777. He was married Sep- 
tember 3, 1 741. to Phebe Seeley. who died March 3, 1764. The same year he

December 20, 1810, and acquired his education in the public schools. In 
early life he engaged in farming, but afterward carried on merchandising in 
Philadelphia and Greenwich, making his home in the latter place. He was 
also the owner of a number of \essels and was president of the board of direc- 
tors of a steamboat company. His varied business interests brought to him 
a handsome competence that enabled him to spend the last thirty years of his 
life in retirement from labor, his income from his investments being suf^cient 
to supply him with all the necessaries and many of the comforts of life. He 
held a number of local offices and gave his political support to the Republican 
party. He was also a member of Brearley Lodge, F. & A. M., and three of 
his sons were connected with the Masonic fraternity, the family zealously ad- 
vocating that organization. His death occurred April 12, 1896, and the 
community thereby lost one of its most valued representatives. He was 
married September 17, 1833, to Hannah Harding, who was born October 21, 
181 1, and died April 10, 1893. They had five children: George B., who was 
born February 15, 1834, married Harriet Mason; Martha Ewing, who was 
born March 29, 1837, became the wife of Joseph Blaine and after his death 
married John F. Wheaton; John Nelson, who was born December 15, 1842, 
married Abigail Moore; James Hampton, who was born January 16, 1845.

Waller; and Samuel Patterson. 

The last named was the father of our subject. He was born March 27. 
1850. in Greenwich, Cumberland county, and obtained his education in the 
public schools of his native town and in Shiloh Academy. He learned the 
blacksmith's trade under the direction of his brother George, and followed 
that pursuit for twenty years, or until the fall of 1887, when he became a 
candidate for county clerk. He was defeated for that office, but the following- 
year was elected surrogate by a majority of eight hundred, his term continu- 
ing until 1893. He was then re-elected, by a majority of two thousand, and 
held the office until 1898, discharging his duties in a most creditable manner, 
which fact was indicated by the increased vote given him at his second elec- 
tion. Since his retirement he has been engaged in the real-estate business, 
and is also connected with other business enterprises, for he is a man of re- 
sourceful ability and his efforts have contributed to the prosperity of several

commercial concerns. He is now president of the Crystal Ice & Cold Storage 
Company and a director in the Bridgeton Gas Company. In politics he is a

party, while in former years he long served as chairman of the county board 
of assessors. He is past master of Brearley Lodge. F. & A. M.. and a member 
of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics. In all life's relations he

James Hampton Fithian. whose name heads this record, was born in 
Greenwich, Cumberland county. December 16. 1873. and in the public schools 
of his native town acquired his preliminary education, which was supple- 
mented by a course in the West Jersey Academy, in which he was graduated 
in 1890. In June of the following year he entered the ofifice of the Hon. 
Thomas W. Trenchard. the present law judge of Cumberland county, and 
was admitted as an attorney in February. 1895. and as a counselor in 1898. 
In September, 1895. he entered into partnership with George Hampton, 
under the firm name of Hampton & Fithian. and this firm is now one of the 
strongest in the county. Their clientage is very extensive and the litigation 
with which they are connected is of an important character. People do not 
trust their legal business to unskilled hands, and the large practice 
which the firm enjoys is therefore an indication of their ability. Mr. Fithian 
is yet a young man. but has attained prestige at the bar which might well be 
envied by many an older practitioner. He is a close student, prepares his 
cases with great thoroughness and is logical and forceful in presenting his 
case before court and jury. In May. 1897. he was elected county counsel to 
the board of free holders and was re-elected in 1898 and again in 1899. In 
the spring of the last named year he was appointed prosecutor of the pleas 
of Cumberland county and is a member of the Cumberland County Bar As- 
sociation and the State Prosecutors Association. His advancement in the 
profession has been marked. He is an indefatigable and earnest worker, 
proficient in every department of the law and again and again has won the 
victorious laurels of competitors of marked abilitv. He is quick to note his

!Mr. Fithian was married on the 26th of April. 1898. to Miss Alary E. 
Robbins. a daughter of W. W. Robl^ins, a prominent citizen and extensive 
dry goods merchant of Bridgeton. They have one child. J. Hampton, who 
was born May 15, 1899. Air. Fithian holds membership in the Junior Order 
of United American Alechanics, in the Bridgeton Camera Society and in the 
Presbyterian church. His is a well rounded development, in which due atten- 
tion has been given to business, social, political and moral interests. Cordial 
in disposition, courteous in deportment and of frank and genial manner, he 
has won man_\- friends and is very popular. 



SAIITH THOAIPSON. 



Among those who tlevote their energies to agricultural pursuits in East 
Greenwich township, Gloucester county, is Smith Thompson, who was born 
near Paulsboro, New Jersey, February 22. 1856, and is a son of Isaac L. and 
Elizabeth (Clark) Thompson. The father, a farmer by occupation, removed 
with his family to Alaryland in 1863, and died soon after, at the age of forty- 
six years. The mother still survives her husband and is now living in Pauls- 
boro with her son, Garrett Thompson. In the family were nine children: 
Isaac, a farmer residing near Paulsboro; Annie, the widow of Samuel Shoe- 
maker, of Camden: Garrett. \\'ho follows carpentering in Paulsboro: Alar- 
garet, who wedded William Johnson, and after his death becarfte the wife of 
William Roecap, of Mullica Hill, New Jersey; Beulah, the widow- of George 
Powell, of Philadelphia: Alary, the wife of Emanuel Barto. of Alarcus Hook, 
Pennsylvania: Smith, of this review: Ida, the wife of Samuel Heritage, of 
Thorofare: and Clayton, a farmer of East Greenwich township, Gloucester 
county. 

In the public schools of Thorofare and Paulsboro Air. Thompson acquired 
his education and throughout his life has followed farming as a means of live- 
lihood. He carried on agricultural pursuits in Deptford township until 1873. 
when he removed to East Greenwich township. In 1894 he purchased his 
present farm of forty-five acres, locating thereon the following year. He 
managed his business affairs with capability and his energy and practical 
methods are bringing to him a fair income. 

On the I2th of Alarch. 1884, was celebrated the marriage of Air. Thomji- 
son and Aliss Alice D. Parker, a daughter of Restore L. Parker, of East 
Greenwich township. Gloucester county. They now have two children: C.

Edgar and Caddie R. Mr. Thompson is a member of the Paulsboro Meth- 
odist Episcopal church, and he also belongs to the Independent Order of 
Odd Fellows-, the Ancient Order of United Workmen and the Patrons 
of Husbandry, of Swedesboro. In politics he is a Republican. He and his 
wife have a wide acquaintance in this community and enjoy the high regard 
of a large circle of friends. 



ALBERT HERITAGE. 



Many lines of activity afford opportunity to but a limited number. The 
chances for advancement in military and political life are but comparatively 
few, but in the realms of commerce and agriculture it is possible for all to 
attain success if they but follow honoral:)le business methods and are ener- 
getic, determined and industrious. Albert Heritage is one who is closely 
connected with the farming interests of Gloucester county, being the owner 
of a valuable and highly cultivated tract of land in Woolwich township. He 
was born in East Greenwich township, in the same county, July i, 1856, 
and is a son of Charles and Martha R. (Borton) Heritage, who now reside 
near Wolferth Station, New Jersey. He was educated in the Friends school 
of Mickleton and remained with his father upon the farm until 1880, when 
he began farming on his own account at the place which is now his home. 
He purchased the property in 1883, and is to-day the owner of one hundred 
acres of valuable land, on which he is successfully carrying on the business 
of gardening and the raising of poultry. For the products of the place he 
finds a ready market in the surrounding towns, and is carrying on business 
systematically, prosecuting his labors with energy and is meeting with a 
well merited prosperity. His labors are conducted on a scientific basis. He 
has made a careful study of the habits and needs of the various vegetables 
wdiich he cultivates and of the poultry which he raises, and his thorough un- 
derstanding of the business enables him to so conduct it as to secure there- 
from excellent financial results. 

On the 29th of November, 1883, Mr. Heritage was united in marriage 
to Miss Rebecca G. Batten, a daughter of John B. Batten, then a resident 
of Woolwich township, Gloucester county, but now living in Philadelphia. 
Seven children have been born of their union, namely: Clififord B.; Ray- 
mond E., who died at the age of six months; Clara B.; Emma A., who died 
in infancy; Alice R.; Warren, who died at the age of six months; and Edith 
May. Mr. Heritage and his family are meml^ers of the Society of Friends, 
and sociallv he is connected with the Ancient Order of United Workmen

and with Swedesboro Grange, of which he is a very active member. He 
formerly served as its master and frequently addresses the Grange on matters 
of moment to the organization. He exercises his right of franchise in sup- 
port of men and measures of the Republican party, and since 1885 has been 
a member of the school board, serving for three years as its president. The 
cause of education finds in him a warm friend, and in his ofificial capacity he 
has done much to advance its interests and to raise the standard of the schools 
in his community. He belongs to that class of public-spirited, progressive 
men who withhold their support from no measure calculated to promote the 
general welfare. His life history should serve to prove as a source of encour- 
agement and inspiration to others, for depending entirely upon his own 
etYorts he has steadily worked his way upward until he is to-day accounted 
one of the most substantial and reliable citizens of his native countv. 



WILLIAAI J. MOORE. 



Prominently connected with the business interests of Bridgeton, William 
Joel Moore has for some years figured conspicuously in connection with its 
material interests and so honorable has been his dealings that in all life's re- 
lations he commands the respect and esteem of his fellow men. He was born 
in Franklinville, Gloucester county. New Jersey. August 31, 1851, and is a 
son of Jacob M. and Abigail (Reeves) Moore. His paternal grandfather, 
Joel Moore, was bom in Deerfield township, Cumberland county, and 
throughout his business career conducted a general merchandise establish- 
ment in that place, but several years prior to his death he retired to private 
life. His political support was given to the Republican party and he was a 
recognized leader in its ranks, doing all in his power to secure its success. In 
1850 he was elected to the state legislature and discharged his duties so ac- 
ceptably that he was re-elected for the succeeding term. He held member- 
ship in the Presbyterian church, and died at the age of seventy-five years, 
while his wife, Mrs. Cora Moore, passed away at the age of seventy-six 
years. 

Their only child, Jacob M. Moore, was born in Deerfield, Cumberland 
county, about 1827, spent his youth there and for some time had charge of 
his father's general store. Subsequently he went to Philadelphia, where he 
engaged in the wholesale dry-goods business, and about the year 1850 he was 
married and located in Bridgeton, where he established a grocery store, 
which he conducted for a number of years. About 1870 he entered into 
partnership with his son, William J. Moore, in the hat and shoe business, and

their constantly increasing patronage forced them to seek more commodious 
quarters: accordingly they erected a large three-story brick block on South 
Laurel street, the first floor being devoted to four large store-rooms, while 
the upper floors were utilized as an opera house. As their financial resources 
increased, Mr. Moore made judicious investments in real estate and is to-day 
the owner of much valuable property. He is now living retired in Bridgeton, 
liis well directed and conservative efforts in former years having brought to 
him a handsome competence that now surrounds him with all the comforts of 
life. Since he attained his majority he has been a member of the Independent 
Order of Odd Fellows, and since the organization of the Republican party 
he has been one of its stalwart supporters. His membership in the Meth- 
odist Episcopal church at Bridgeton covers a long period and for many years 
he has served as one of the trustees. His life has been an honorable and up- 
right one, commending him to the confidence and good will of all, and he is 
regarded as one of the most prominent, influential and highly respected resi- 
dents of Bridgeton. In 1896 he was called upon to mourn the loss of his 
wife, who died at the age of seventy-two years. 

W'illiam J. Moore, their only son, acquired his elementary education in 
the public schools and later attended the West Jersey Academy. After put- 
ting aside his text-books and receiving some preliminary business training, 
he became associated with his father in the hat and shoe business, and after 
the erection of the new business block he was the manager of the o]5era 
house. Since 1880 he has given his entire attention to that work, in addition 
to caring for his real-estate interests, which included the ownership of a 
number of residences and several farms. From his property he derives a good 
income, which is largely supplemented by his returns from the opera house, 
and Bridgeton is fortunate in having such a man as Mr. Moore in charge 
of its leading place of amusement. All well balanced people recognize the 
importance of entertainment in life, for the person whose attention is given 
to business alone becomes one-sided in his development and his faculties 
along other lines are blunted. Great care, however, should be taken in choos- 
ing the forms of amusement, and in this regard Mr. Moore's efforts have 
been of peculiar benefit to Bridgeton. He is very careful to maintain a high 
standard in connection with the amusements which he places upon the stage, 
and manv of the best actors, lecturers and musicians of the country have 
been heard in Bridgeton. The opera house is attractive in appearance, well 
lighted, tastefully decorated, heated by steam and supphed with electricity 
and gas. Here are held all the entertainments given by the Young Men's 
Christian Association, the Musical Union and the schools, and the Moore

Opera House fills a position of usefulness in the community as a place of pub- 
lic assembly that is worthy of note. 

Mr. Moore has also been an important factor in connection with munic- 
ipal affairs, and he withholds his support from no measure which he believes 
a public good. He has frequently been called upon to aid in conducting the 
business affairs of the city, having been a member of the board of freeholders 
for two terms and a member of the city council for three years. In 1899 he 
was elected to the lower house of the state legislature and is now filling the 
position of representative in a most creditable way, discharging his duty in 
a manner most satisfacton,- to his constituents. He is a stanch Republican 
in his political views, and has frequently served as a delegate to the local, 
congressional and state conventions, where his opinions are received with 
consideration, his counsels carrying weight among the representatives of his 
party. He was also commissioner of appeals for a number of terms. 

On the 1st of March, 1872, Mr. Moore was united in marriage to Miss 
Emma H. Boss, a daughter of Joseph Boss, a shoe-merchant of Bridgeton. 
They have two children: Edward \V.,. who is a bookkeeper in New York 
city; and Mary W., the wife of Edward H. Graves, the genial host of the 
Cumberland Hotel at Bridgeton. Mr. Moore and his wife are members of 
the Second Presbyterian church, and in social circles they occup\- an enviable 
position. He is a man of fine personal appearance, social and cordial in man- 
ner and popular with all classes. 



CHRISTIAN A. MADDEX. 

Christian A. Madden, the superintendent of the Woodbury Glass Works, 
was born in Franklin township, Gloucester county, October 14, 1839. His 
ancestors were numbered among the early settlers of this state, and for sev- 
eral generations they have been prominent workers in the glass-manufactur- 
ing industry. 

Hoosier Madden, the great-grandfather of our subject, came to America 
prior to the war of the Revolution, from Scotland, his native country. He 
was accompanied by his family, and made a settlement near Port Elizabeth, 
New Jersey. He then engaged in farming and from time to time made pur- 
chases of land along the Marsh river. At last he was called to the better 
land, and his remains were placed to rest in the old cemetery at Port Eliza- 
beth. His son Martin, who was our subject's grandfather, was born in Scot- 
land and was a young man at the time that the family crossed the Atlantic 
ocean. He had learned the trade of slass-blower and worked at that callins: 



COXGRESSIOX.IL DISTRICT OF XEIV JERSEY. 427 

during the greater part of his hfe. For a wife he chose a Miss Stanger. 
whose family had located in New Jersey at an early day, seven brothers of 
the name having settled on Alloway creek during the colonial period. They, 
too, were glass-blowers by trade, and were the first to introduce the industry 
and build the first glass-works in the United States. Their original factory 
was destroyed by the British troops during the Revolution, and after peace 
had settled upon this nation again the brothers separated, some founding 
homes in Glassboro and Brooklyn, while the others remained at Port Eliza- 
beth, though all continued to work at their old trade. To the union of 
Martin and Sarah Madden three sons were born: Martin. Hoosier and 
John. Hoosier, the second son. was born at Port Ehzabeth, and in his 
young manhood followed the business of glass-blowing. Subsequently he 
removed to Cape ]\Iay countv, where for several years he engaged in mer- 
cantile pursuits, and later he gave his attention to agriculture. For one term 
he was the sheriff of Cape May county, and at the time of his death he w-as 
serving his third year as senator from his district. To himself and wife. 
Catherine, five children were born, namely: Dr. Edward; Thomas, who 
has occupied a position in the state penitentiary since 1876; Braddock, who is 
engaged in the iron and tin business in Chicago; Hope, residing upon the 
old homestead: and Otis, deceased, and formerly the postmaster of Tuckahoe, 
New Jersey. John ]\Iadden. the youngest son of Martin and Sarah INIadden, 
also a native of Port Elizabeth, learned the glass-cutters' trade at Millville. 
New Jersev, and later was the superintendent of the Woods Window Glass 
\\'orks there for fifteen years. He was honored by being elected to repre- 
sent his district in the state legislature, officiated as a member of the city 
council and occupied numerous other local positions of trust. He married 
Mary Wilson and their children were Wilson, Wallace and INIary, the latter 
becoming the w-ife of Alfred Goodwin, of Millville. 

Martin Madden, the eldest son of Martin and Sarah Madden, and the 
father of our subject, was Ijorn at Port Elizalaeth in 1809, and, like his broth- 
ers, became interested in the manufacture of glass when he was young, 
and pursued this calling throughout life. He was united in marriage with 
Rebecca Powell, the daughter of Isaac Powell, a prosperous and leading citi- 
zen of Millville. New Jersey, where he was engaged in contracting and Ijuild- 
ing. The Powell family, original]}- from Haddonfield. New Jersey, were 
members of the Society of Friends. To the union of Martin and Rebecca 
Madden ten children were born, named as follows: Mary, deceased, for- 
merly the wife of Charles Parker; Cooper, deceased; Martin, who married 
Elizabeth Clark and resides in Bridgeton, this state; Christian A.; Hoosier. 
who wedded Ella Dawson and resides at Atlanta, Georgia; Henr\-, who died

in 1895. at the age of fifty-four years, and whose wife, formerly Martha Rich- 
mond, also has passed away; Rachel, the wife of William Backus, of Philadel- 
phia; Rebecca, deceased, the wife of Nathan Gregory, of Camden, New Jer- 
sey; Horace, a citizen of Columbus. Ohio; and Emma, the wife of Ralph 
Kinch, of Newbold. New Jersey. The father of these children was sum- 
moned to the silent land in 1895. 

Christian A. Madden, as previously stated, is a native of this county, and 
in his boyhood gained a liberal education in the public schools. When less 
than fifteen years of age he began serving an apprenticeship to the glass- 
blowers' trade, in the works of Thomas Stanger, at Brooklyn. New Jersey. 
He became very proficient at his trade, and for nearly a quarter of a century 
— from 1857 to 1881 — he was employed bv one firm, — Moore Brothers, of 
Clayton, New Jersey, leaving them only when his present responsible posi- 
tion was proffered him. 

The Woodbury Glass Works were organized in 1881 Ijy thirty-one glass- 
blowers, as a co-operative stock company. G. G. Green being elected presi- 
dent, Israel Voorhees. secretary and treasurer, and C. A. Madden, superin- 
tendent. Since the ]ilant was established it has been greatly enlarged and 
improved, and now four furnaces and four continuous tanks, with a capacity 
of from one hundred to one hundred and seventy-five tons, are in constant 
operation. Employment is afforded to about two hundred hands and 
everything is in a flourishing condition, thanks to the thoroughness and gen- 
eral efficiency of the officers of the company. At present they are: G. G. 
Green, president; W. H. Beckett, general business manager, and C. A. Mad- 
den, superintendent of the glass-blowing department. The company manu- 
factures bottles exclusively, and in all sizes, from the smallest to the largest 
used in the trade. A visit to the works well repays the traveler, who cannot 
fail to admire the excellent system, the modern appliances used and the 
beauty of the manufactured articles. The public has had more than ordinary 
interest in the success of this enterprise, because it was not organized by. 
and for the benefit of, a few wealthy capitalists, but on the contrary was or- 
ganized by and for the skilled workmen who have brought it to its paying 
and flourishing state. To Mr. Madden, whose wise supervision has not re- 
laxed for the eighteen years he has been connected with the enterprise, much 
praise is due. and every man who is interested in the welfare of the company 
has been a stanch friend and willing assistant to him in his arduous labors. 
He is justly popular with the officers and various members of the company, 
and it would be difficult, indeed, to adequately fill his place. 

On the 20th of August, i860. Mr. Madden married Mar)- F. Morgan, a 
daughter of Peter and Sarah Morgan, of Clavton. New Jersev. Thev lie-

came the parents of six children, three sons and three daughters, namely: 
George H., who wedded Maggie Pugh; Anthony G., whose wife was Har- 
riet Lane in her girlhood; Harry, who married Louisa :\Ierchant: ^lary E.; 
Ada and Emma. 

The cause of education and all movements calculated to l:.enefit the com- 
munity have received the warm endorsement of Mr. Madden. He has served 
as the' president of the school lioard in Woodbury and has been the commit- 
teeman of the township. Socially, he is a member of Forest Grove Lodge, 
No. 91, F. & A. M.. and is one of its past masters, and in lona Lodge. No. 38. 
L O. O. F., he is the past noble grand. In political matters he is an uncom- 
promising Democrat. Religiously he is a Presbyterian, and held the office 
of trustee in the Clayton Presbyterian church for some years before coming 
to Woodbury. 

B. FRANK RULON. 

Benjamin F. Rulon resides at the ancestral home of the family, the farm 
having come into possession of his grandfather, Moses Rulon, in 1807. 
Since that time the family name has been connected with its ownership. The 
grandfather married Susan Hartley, and among their children was Mark T. 
Rulon, the father of our subject, who resided on the old homestead until 
his death, which occurred in 1892. when he had attained the advanced age 
of eighty-two years. His wife bore the maiden name of Elizabeth Williams, 
and her death occurred in 188 1, when she was sixty-six years of age. In their 
family were nine children: Theodosia B., who died at the age of fifty years: 
Benjamin Franklin, of this review; Joseph, who resides in Swedesboro; 
. Fannie, the wife of D. Winfield Sithens, of Mullica Hill, New Jersey; Mary, 
the wife of J. Wesley Shoemaker, deceased, of Wilmington, Delaware; 
Rachel, the deceased wife of John Conley, a school-teacher of Berkley, New 
Jersey; George, who died at the age of two years: George, the second of 
the name, who died at the age of ten years; and Lizzie, who passed away at 
the age of eight years. 

Mr. Rulon. whose name introduces this review, was born on the 17th of 
September. 1845, on the old family homestead which is still the place of his 
residence. His preliminary education, acquired in the public schools of his 
native town, was supplemented by study in the Swedesboro Academy. He 
early became familiar with the labors of the field and assisted his father un.til 
1876. when he 1;iegan business on his own account. In 1883 he assumed 
the management of the home farm, and he purchased the property in 1892. 
He has given considerable attention to the stud_\- of the scientific principles

which underHe the cultivation of cereals, and his knowledge of agricnltin-e 
is comprehensive and accurate. In his every-day duties he is practical and 
systematic, and the appearance of the place indicates a spirit of neatness, 
thrift and enterprise. 

On the 13th of December. 1871. ]\Ir. Rulon led to the marriage altar Miss 
Elmira W. Moore, a daughter of Ezekiel C. Moore, of Woolwich township, 
Gloucester county. Their only child, Edward, now cultivates a part of his 
father's farm. He married Miss Eveline H., a daughter of William A. Shirler. 
of Swedesboro. and they have two children, — Henr\- E. and Anna M. Mr. 
Rulon. of this review, is a past master workman of the Ancient Order of 
United \\'orkmen and is an active member of the Swedesboro Grange. His 
political support is given the Republican party and his religious faith is in 
harmony with the doctrines of the Society of Friends, with which organiza- 
tion he and his family are identified. 

The fact that many wdio have known him from boyhood have for him 
the highest respect is an indication that his life has been well spent. His 
business interests occupy the greater part of his time and attention, but he 
is always true to his duties of citizenship and is earnest and zealous in his 
support of all measures calculated to advance the general welfare. 



ROBERT E. HAND. 



High on the roll of New Jersey's eminent citizens appears the name of 
Robert Edmonds Hand, who is now representing his district in the state 
senate. For many years he has figured conspicuously in connection with 
public affairs and his record is alike creditable to himself and the people 
whom he represents in the law-making body of the commonwealth. It is 
a well attested maxim that the greatness of a state lies not in its machinery 
of government, nor even in its institutions, but in the sterling quahties of 
its individual citizens, in their capacity for high and unselfish effort and their 
devotion to the public good. To this class belongs Mr. Hand. The goal 
toward which he has hastened iluring his many years of toil and endeavor is 
that which is attained only by such men as have by patriotism and wise coun- 
sel given the world an impetus toward the good; such have gained the right 
and title to have their names enduringly inscribed on the bright pages of 
history. 

Robert E. Hand was born where he now resides, in Lower township. 
Cape ]\Iay county, June 28. 1854. his parents being Parsons and May L. 
(Parsons) Hand. His paternal grandfather w as one of the first tea merchants

and a very prominent business man of Philadelphia. He resided in Chester 
county and had a beautiful home in Philadelphia, together with a country 
seat. The father of our subject was l)orn in Chester county, Pennsylvania, 
in 1803, and died in 1876. He was educated in the common schools and 
removing to Cape May county located at Emma, where he owned and culti- 
vated a farm of two hundred acres. His political support was given the Re- 
publican party. He held membership in the Cold Spring Presbyterian church, 
and for forty years was a regular attendant on its services. He was twice 
married, his first union being with Sarah Miller, by whom he had one child, 
Clara Louise, who became the wife of Reuben Foster, who followed mer- 
chandising in Baltimore, Maryland, and was also the owner of a line of steam- 
ers. He became very wealthy, acquiring his capital entirely through his own 
efforts. Mr. and Mrs. Foster had but one child, Uriah. After the death of 
his first wife Parsons Hand married Judith Cresse, and they had a daughter, 
Judith, wife of Reuben Hoffman, of Cape May. His third wife was Mar}' 
Parsons, and they became the parents of two children, Robert and Mary 
Elizabeth, the daughter being the wife of Robert Hill, chief building in- 
spector of Philadelphia and a leading and influential citizen. They have one 
child, Edna ^Miriam. The father of our subject died in April, 1876, at the 
age of seventy-three years, and the mother passed away in 1877, at the age of 
fifty-three years. 

'Sir. Hand, whose name forms the caption of this article, obtained his edu- 
cation in the public schools of Emma, where he pursued his studies for about 
three months each year, spending the remainder of the year upon the farm, 
his time being devoted to the work of field and meadow. At the age of 
eighteen he left school, but remained with his father until he had attained 
his majority, when he went to sea as second mate. For five years his expe- 
riences were those of a "life on the ocean wave," and then he resumed farm- 
ing and also became connected with other industries. He does an extensive 
business as an oyster gardener and also gets out timber, which he sells under 
contract. He owns about fifteen hundred acres of farm and wooded lands, 
and the income derived from the fields and woodlands have made him one 
of the wealthy residents of the community. He also does general contract 
work and is financially interested in the Summit Hotel, where he has thirty 
acres of bay front land. He is the controlling stockholder in the Star of the 
Cape, of Cape May city, the only straight Republican paper in the countv. 
and in the management of these various business enterprises displays excel- 
lent executive ability and sound judgment. 

Mr. Hand is a stalwart Republican in his political views, and has held a 
number of public positions of honor and trust. For fifteen vears he has

About the year 1827 he took charge and was in command of the steamer

stated. Joseph S. and William Gleeson assisted their father upon the farm 
until his death, when they inherited the estate. A portion of the original 
homestead had been sold, but they have repurchased the greater part of it 
and added other land until now they have about two hundred acres under 
fine cultivation, with good buildings, and which constitutes one of the best 
properties in Gloucester county. They do a general truck-farming and grain- 
growing business, under the firm name of J. S. & W. Gleeson, and have been 
very successful in their enterprises. They are lioth members of the Patrons of

BENJAMIN HANCOCK. 

\'arious indeed are the interests \\hich have occupied the attention of 
Benjamin Hancock, and his efforts have been so discerningly directed along 
man}' lines that it would he. difiicult to determine the power of his greatest 
usefulness. This is an age of utihtarianism, and the claim has been made that 
the extent and magnitude of commercial afifairs are crowding out all oppor- 
tunity for advancement along other lines; but an investigation of the condi- 
tions of our country will show the marked progress which has been made in 
esthetic, educational and moral development, and the political position of the 
nation is commanding respect and attention never before accorded to it. 
These conditions are not due to the favored few who occupy places of leader- 
ship before the world, but result from the aggregate efTort of patriotic, pub- 
lic-spirited and honorable men throughout the nation. 

Each community furnishes a number of these, and such an one in Bridge- 
ton is Benjamin Hancock. His life history began April 2, 1838, his birth hav- 
ing occurred in Canton. Salem county. New Jersey. His parents were Daniel 
P. and Jane Hancock. His paternal grandfather, Benjamin Hancock, resided 
at Canton, spending his entire life there, while as a means of livelihood he 
carried on farming and followed the sea, becoming the captain of a vessel. 
He gave his political support first to the Whig party and afterward to the 
Republican party. Daniel P. Hancock was born on a farm near Canton, in 
August. 1810, received a limited education and in early life worked at hard 
labor. Going to sea he ultimate!}' became the captain of a vessel, and, like 
his father, devoted some time to agricultural pursuits. By his ballot he sup- 
ported the men and measures of the Whig party until its dissolution, when 
he joined the ranks of the Republican party. His religious belief was in 
harmonv with the doctrines of the Baptist church, and he died in that faith at

his home in Canton, in September. 1890. at the age of eighty years. His 
wife passed away in 1885, at tlie age of seventy-four years. In their family 
were eight children. Susan died in infancy. Daniel F.. a blacksmith at 
Canton, who served in the Twenty-fourth Xew Jersey Infantr\- for nine 
months and participated in the l)attles of Fredericksburg and Chancellors- 
ville, married Sarah Hancock and had two sons, — William T. and James. 
Benjamin is the third of the family. William married I.ydia Simpkins and 
had a son, \\'illard. Joanna became the wife of George Thomas and their 
children were Orestes and Mary. Elizabeth married Samuel Shimp and 
their children were Benjamin, who died at the age of three years, and Frank. 
Phoebe, who became the wife of Samuel Newkirk, a resident of Canton, New 
Jersey, and they have two children. — Edward and Jennie. 

Benjamin Hancock, whose name introduces this rexiew. was educated 
in the common schools of Canton until ten years of age, when he removed to 
Hopewell township. Cumberland county. He afterward lived in Dutch Neck 
and afterward at Bridgeton. New Jersey. In these places he pursued his 
studies until twenty-one years of age. after which he engaged in teaching 
singing school in Cumberland and Salem counties, for seven terms, devoting 
his energies to that profession through the winter season and in the summer 
engaging in agricultural pursuits. 

In 1869 Mr. Hancock became a resident of Bridgeton and was made sec- 
retary of the Cumberland Lumber Company. In March, 1870. he went west 
to Bloomington, Illinois, where he spent ten months, and on his return, in 
1 87 1, he purchased the interest of Martin G. Carsten in the firm of Carsten 
& Smith, dealers in stoves, tinware, shelf-ware. etc.. under the firm name of 
Smith & Hancock. They carried on business until November of that year, 
when the senior partner sold his interest to Elmer E. Johnson, and the firm 
of Johnson & Hancock was formed and carried on business until 1889, when 
Mr. Hancock became the sole proprietor. He has a large stock of parlor, 
of^ce and cook-stoves, ranges, heaters and furnaces, plain and japanned tin- 
ware, glass and agate ware and a general assortment of house-furnishing 
goods. His store building on East Commerce street is commodious and well 
adapted to the purpose used. Mr. Hancock, however, has not confined his 
efforts to this line for, being a man of resourceful business ability, his labors 
have encompassed other business interests, and to-day he is connected with 
various concerns which not only promote his individual welfare, but add to 
the general prosperity. He was a director of the Bridgeton National Bank 
and is also a director and president of the Bridgeton Savings Fund &: Build- 
ing Association. He is now the president of the Cumberland Trust Com. 
panv, which does a general Ijanking business, including a sa\'ings and trust. 



438 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

This corporation was organized in July, 1896, and occupies a large brick 
block, twenty-two by eighty feet, and handsomely finished in mahogany trim- 
mings. It is well-equipped for the purpose indicated and the business of the 
company has been constantly growing in volume and importance. Its direc- 
torate comprises the names of some of the best men of the county, and the 
fact that Mr. Hancock is at its head is an assurance of its reliability and trust- 
worthiness. 

.\t all times Mr. Hancock has been loyal to his duties of citizenship, and 
in September, 1862, he gave evidence of his patriotic spirit by joining Com- 
pany F, Twenty-fourth Regiment of New Jersey Volunteers, which served in 
Virginia and participated in the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellors- 
ville. He was always faithful in his duty to the cause represented by the old 
flag, and. in a more quiet way he has ever labored for the welfare of the com- 
munity with which he is connected. He is a trustee of the South Jersey In- 
stitute and the president of the board; and the cause of education has ever 
found in him a warm friend. For nine years he has been a member of the 
school board of Bridgeton and is now its president, and the high standard 
maintained in the schools is due in no small degree to his efforts in behalf of 
educational interests of the town. In politics he is a Republican, and for 
five years was a meml)er of the hoard of chosen freeholders, serving for three 
years as its president. He was for nine years a memljer of the city council as 
a representative of the third ward, being elected as a temperance issue on 
the Republican ticket for two terms and for one term as an independent 
candidate. 

On the 24th of September, 1873, Mr. Hancock was married to Miss Laura 
I. Major, a daughter of C. Major, a retired farmer of Bloomington. Illinois. 

They have one child, Mabel Claire, at home. The family hold member- 
ship in the Berean Baptist church in Bridgeton, and Mr. Hancock is serving 
as one of its deacons. For forty years he has been a choir-leader and for 
several years has been the superintendent of the Sunday-school. His kindly 
face and helpful manner at once give evidence of his character. He is ever 
ready to assist those who are anxious to help themsel\es. and his words of 
encouragement and counsel as well as material aid have enabled many a 
young man to pass over the rough places in the journey of life. He has 
realized the importance of development along physical, mental and moral 
lines, that man's nature is in this respect a trinity and that the greatest good 
can be realized by the proper improvement of the three forces of his nature. 
While active and energetic in business he is always straightforward and re- 
liable, and though his interests are extensive he has ever found time to devote 
to the affairs which lead to intellectual and moral impro\ement.

CHARLES C. FORD. 

This gentleman is the well known and popular proprietor of the Ford 
Hotel, of Salem, one of the leading hotels in this section of the state. By 
well directed efifort he has attained an enviable position in business circles, 
and is a popular and respected citizen whose circle of friends is almost co- 
extensive with the circle of his acquaintances. 

A native of Gloucester county. New Jersey, he was born on the 28th of 
March, 1827, his parents being Thomas and Rebecca (Paul) Ford. The 
family is of English origin and has long been identified with the history of 
New Jersey, the first of the name having located in the state during the colo- 
nial epoch of the country's annals. William Ford, grandfather of our 
subject, was a well known agriculturist who settled near Paulsboro, Glou- 
cester county, becoming one of the leading citizens of that community. In 
1779 he was united in marriage to Miss Lydia Thompson, and to them were 
born the following named children: \\'illiam: Margaret, wife of Joshua 
Pine; Lydia, wife of Noah Gibson; John; Maria, wife of Adrian Paul; Abbie, 
wife of John Mulford: Anna, wife of Thomas Wilson: and Thomas. The 
last named was born November 10, 1798, and on the loth of February, 1825, 
married Miss Rebecca Paul, who was born November 13, 1802. Their union 
was blessed with the following children: George T., who was born November 
22, 1825, and died October 29, 1893; Charles C. : Lydia, who was born Octo- 
ber 29, 1828, and became tlie wife of Absalom R. Leal and died August 29, 
1881 ; William, bom December 29, 1832; Mary C, who was born December 
2. 1834, and is the wife of William C. Kirby; Anna, who was born October 
29. 1836, became the wife of W'illiam C. Kirby and died August 31, 1862; 
and Rebecca H., who was born April i, 1844. Thomas Ford, the father of 
these children, was an enterprising farmer, upright and honorable in all 
things, and was widely and favorably known in the community in which he 
made his home. He was a Whig in his political affiliations in early life, but 
on the organization of the Republican party joined its ranks and was one of 
its loyal advocates until his death, which occurred July 11, 1868. 

Charles C. Ford, Salem's well known representative of this old and hon- 
ored family, spent his boyhood days upon the farm. It is remarkable what a 
great proportion of our leading men in business and public life have come 
from the farm. Reared amid the strengthening and ennobling influences of 
nature, they are well fitted to cope with the questions which are daily coming 
up for settlement in commercial circles, and with unbiased judgment they 
pass upon the questions of state and national importance. Amid the scenes 
of rural life Mr. Ford was reared, and as soon as old enough to handle the 



440 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

plow he performed his share of the labor connected with the development 
and cultivation of the fields. After attaining his majority he began farming 
on his own account, and was identified with the agricultural interests of the 
county until forty years of age. when he entered the hotel business at Woods- 
town. Salem county. He became proprietor of the Washington Hotel, which 
he conducted until 1881. when he took charge of the Nelson Hotel, in Salem, 
managing the same until 1891. In that year he erected the Ford Hotel, 
which was opened in September of the same year. It is the leading hotel in 
the county and one of the best in southern New Jersey, being equipped with 
all the necessary modern conveniences, including good ventilation and taste- 
ful furniture. The cuisine offers many attractions and the excellent enter- 
tainment afforded the guests secures a liberal patronage. The hotel has in- 
deed found favor with the traveling puljlic, and the proprietor is also very 
popular. 

In 1849 was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Ford and Miss Hannah F. 
Moore, a daughter of Joseph H. Moore, of Greenwich, Gloucester county. 
New Jersey. They have four children: John J., now a practicing attorney 
of Salem; Florence V.. who is the widow of Alfred T. Burr and has a 
daughter, Ethel M. Burr; Mary B. and Charles C. The family is one of 
prominence in the community, its members holding an enviable position in 
social circles. Mr. Ford is a Republican in his political affiliations and a 
leader in all public enterprises and movements which tend to advance the 
welfare and upbuilding of the city. His social' qualities and genial dispo- 
sition render him a favorite w ith his patrons, and his earnest desire to please 
them makes him well deserving of the success which is attending his labors. 



JACOB HOUSE. 

Jacolj House, a substantial and wealthy resident of the \illage of .\lloway. 
is a son of Jonathan and Frances (Blackwood) House and was born January 
7, 1836. in Alloway Creek township, this county, on the same land and in 
the same house in which several generations of the family were born and 
which he now owns. His great-grandfather was Jacob House, who came 
here at an early day and was an expert glass-worker, employed in the first 
factory operated in Salem and built by a Mr. Wistar. The name is a contrac- 
tion of Houseman, common usage changing it to the shorter name. House. 
He was a soldier for American liberty, as was his brother Jonathan, and lived 
to the ripeness of age. dying December 21. 1786. He also engaged in agri- 
cultural pursuits and married ^lary Oakford. who was born August 5. 1740. 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEIV JERSEY. 441 

a daughter of William Oakford, a large land-owner of this township. Their 
children were Anna, born April 8, 1765; Margaret, bom January 27, 1768; 
William (ist), born July 18, 1770: and William (2d), born November 2j, 
1 77 1. William House, the grandfather, was born in the little brick house 
which was erected by his father and became a farmer of some means, owning 
some two or three thousand acres of land in Upper Alloway Creek town- 
ship, which was divided among his two children at his death. He was an 
influential man of his time and held many ofifices of trust. He was married 
May 29, 1796, to Miss Sarah W^ood, who was born July 14, 1772, and bore 
him two children: Jonathan, the father of our subject; and Mary, who was 
born January 2, 1801, and was the wife of William Sherron. Both parents 
died in 1802, at an early age, the mother being in her thirtieth year and the 
father three years older. 

Jonathan House, the father, was born September 25, 1798, in the little 
brick house on the old homestead and was a child in his fourth year when 
he was deprived of his parents. His uncle, John \\'ood, took both little 
ones to his home and cared for them until they went to homes of their own. 
Jonathan grew to manhood and became a tiller of the soil and also operated 
a sawmill and built a number of ships. He owned a large acreage and his last 
days were spent on his farm. He was a warm sympathizer with the Democ- 
racy and served on town committees for several years, was a lay judge of 
this county, and was a member of the Society of Friends. His chief pleasure 
was derived from his own fireside and as a business man he had few superiors. 
His wife was Miss Frances Blackwood, who bore him three sons and two 
daughters, viz.: William, who was born in 1822, was a merchant and sur- 
veyor of this village, where he died in his fifty-eighth year: his wife was Eliza- 
beth Carll, by whom he had one son, John, now deceased; Mary H. married 
David Ewen, of Alloway: Ann was born in 1852 and married Edward W'hite, 
since deceased, a surrogate of Cumberland county, and a resident of Bridge- 
ton: their children are Fannie and Mary; Jacob, our subject; and Jonathan, 
who is elsewhere represented in this work. 

Jacob House attended the public schools at Alloway, Union Academy, 
Shiloh, and at the age of twenty years entered a large wholesale grocery 
house at Philadelphia, where he clerked for some time. He then returned 
home and became a farmer, moving on the farm in i860 and remaining there 
forty-eight years on the old homestead which had come into his possession, 
before he retired from active work and took up his residence in the village 
of Alloway. He owns one hundred acres of fine land there and considerable 
timber land: one of the largest tracts of first-growth timber in the county 
belongs to him. He operates a sawmill and makes large quantities of lum-

ber, which finds a ready sale. He has been director of the Salem National 
Banking Company for several years and is a careful business man. 

Mr. House was married September 6, i860, to Miss Sarah A. Shimp, a 
daughter of John Shimp, a merchant of Alloway. They have four children: 
Oakford, born March 17, 1861, is a clerk for the Salem Banking Company, 
married a Miss Fox and has one child. Beryl; Harry was born April 10. 1864. 
and is a clerk in a store at Mantua: he married Margaret Bell and has four 
children, — Leon, Herbert. William and an infant; Mary, born April i, 1866. 
married Harry Pettit, a traveling salesman of Salem, and has one child, Mary; 
and Sarah Viola, born November 3, 1873, and lives at home. Mr. House is 
a Democrat but has never dabbled in politics. He is a member of the Inde- 
pendent Order of Odd Fellows and has been the secretary of his lodge since 
its organization twenty-five years ago in Alloway, and he is a member of the 
Knights of Pythias. His religious views are indicated by the fact that he is 
a member of the orthodox Society of Friends. 

William Oakford married Rebecca Mott and was a large land-owner of 
Alloway township. He was a farmer and took an active part in local affairs 
and died in a small brick house which he had erected in 1736. on his farm 
of one hundred acres, which is now in possession of our subject. He had 
two children, Letitia (Mrs. Noblet), of \\'ilmington. Delaware; and Mary, 
who married Jacob House, the great-grandfather. 



CHARLES C. TESSUP. 



One of the busiest, most energetic and most enterprising men of Wood- 
bury, New Jersey, is Charles Clark Jessup, who occupies the position of 
president of the First National Bank. His has been an honorable business 
career, in which he has steadily worked his way upward to a place of promi- 
nence in financial circles. Banking institutions are the heart of the com- 
mercial body, indicating the healthfulness of trade, and the bank that follows 
a safe, conservative policy does more to establish public confidence in times 
of widespread financial depression than anything else. Such a course has 
the First National Bank of Woodbury followed under the able management 
of its president, whose reliability and trustworthiness, combined with busi- 
ness sagacity, have made him one of the most successful as well as leading 
representatives of financial interests in this section of the state. 

Mr. Jessup is also a representative of one of' the oldest and most promi- 
nent families of Gloucester county. He was born in Harrison township, 
March 14, 1847, his parents being Joseph and Mary (Clark) Jessup. The 




-<^:^^«<:^^^^^^Js^:/:^;^ 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 443 

family is of Englisli extraction and was founded in America by John Jessup. 
the great-great-grandfather of our subject, who. in 1737, located in Glouces- 
ter county, taking up his abode near the \illage of Woodbury, in what was 
then the township of Deptford. Little record remains concerning his life, 
but it is generally supposed that he engaged in agricultural pursuits. He 
married Margaret Witticer and unto them were born two children, John and 
Mary, whose descendants are now living in many sections of this country. 
The daughter became the wife of Samuel Mifflin, of Virginia, and the son, 
who was born in 1743. married Elizabeth Ballinger. by whom he had three 
children: James, born November 6. 1769; Sarah, born September 29. 1771; 
and John, born. November 16. 1773. Sarah Jessup became the wife of 
Joshua Lord and had a family of six children, namely: Mary, James, John, 
Elizabeth. Hester and Benjamin. John was twice married, his first wife being 
Deborah Wilkins, whom he wedded Novemljer 15, 1798. and by whom he 
had four children. — Isaac Wilkins. Sarah. William and John. The second 
wife bore the maiden name of Sarah Wood and her children were Elizabeth 
and Charles. James Jessup. who belonged to the same family, was one of 
the ancestors of the subject of this sketch. He married Sarah West, and unto 
them were born five children. — John, James, Joseph, Mary and West. The 
first named. John Jessup, was twice married, and by the first union had two 
children, Sarah and Hannah Ann. For his second wife he chose Mary 
Reeves, and they had one daughter, Mary. James married Abigail Fisher, 
and their children were George, Rebecca. Mary. Abigail and two who were 
accidentally drowned in early life. West, the youngest child of James and 
Sarah (West) Jessup, married Martha Cooper, and their children were John 
W^: Cooper: Hannah; Sarah, now deceased; James: David, deceased; Louis; 
and James, who died in childhood. Joseph Jessup was the father of our sub- 
ject and is represented elsewhere in this volume. 

In taking up the personal history of Charles Clark Jessup we present to 
our readers the life record of one who is widely and favorably known in west- 
ern New Jersey. He attended the district schools of his native place and later 
completed his education by a three-years course in the West Jersey Academy 
at Bndgeton. this state. On laying aside his text-books he embarked in 
general merchandising and in the lumber business at Mantua, Gloucester 
county, forming a partnership under the firm name of Scott & Jessup. He 
was thus engaged when he retired from the firm and went to Philadelphia, 
where he engaged in dealing in house furnishings at the corner of Ninth and 
Market streets. That venture proved to be a very successful one. Mr. Jes- 
sup disposed of his business and returned to \\'oodbury. where his well known 
ability cafised him to be appointed a director of the First National Bank on 



444 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE TIRST 

the 3d of February, 1888. Three years later, on the 31st of March, 1891. he 
was made the vice president of the institution, and on the ist of October, 
1895. was chosen the president, which position he has since acceptably filled. 
He is a man of keen discrimination, of sound judgment and resolute purpose, 
qualities which are ever essential to the successful conduct of a financial in- 
stitution. 

On the 5th of August, 1880, in \^"oodbu^y, Mr. Jessup was united in mar- 
riage to Miss Abbie T. Reeves, a daughter of Thomas and Isabella M. Reeves. 
Their union has been blessed with two children, Isabella K., born November 
25, 1882, and Edward C, bom October 24, 1887. The mother is a lady of 
kindly heart and gracious disposition, who holds membership in the Presby- 
terian church, the services of which her family attend, contributing liberally 
to the support of the church in its various branches of Christian work. Mr. 
Jessup is quiet and unassuming in manner, yet at all times courteous and 
pleasing, winning friends by his genial disposition and honorable character, 
which commands the respect of all. He is public-spirited in an eminent de- 
gree, and during the years of his residence in Woodbury has given his aid 
to whatever is calculated to promote the general welfare. In every relation of 
life he has been true and faithful, and over the record of his active career 
there falls no shadow of wrong, and no suspicion of evil darkens his pathway. 



R. CURTIS ROBINSON. 

R. Curtis Robinson is a representative of the two branches of business 
which have contributed most largely to the upbuilding of towns and to the ad- 
vancement of their progress and prosperity, — real-estate and journalism. 
The man who handles the property interests can largely make or mar the 
place. The improvements which he institutes may be attractive, but he must 
also exercise care in his sales so that a desirable and substantial class of citi- 
zens will form the population of the town which he represents and thus insure 
its future growth along lines of material, intellectual and social progress. 
The real-estate dealer who follows these principles will thus la}- the founda- 
tion for the establishment of a city which will be a power in the state, its 
ever widening circle of influence being manifest in the formation of the 
public policy of the commonwealth. 

It has also been said that there is no surer indication of the character 
of a town than its newspapers. The bright and enterprising journal, of pure 
tone, is an unmistakable evidence of the character of the people who gnve 
it its support and whom it represents. At the same time the editor is in a 



CONGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEiV JERSEY. 445 

position where he can mold pubHc opinion in a way that few others can do, 
and his support of a measure will usually secure it a large following, so tliat 
great responsibility rests upon him in shaping the public mind. 

In both departments of labor ^Ir. Robinson has promoted the interests 
of Ocean Citv. and no record of this attractive town would V)e complete 
without mention of him whose name introduces this review. He was born 
:March 28, 1862, in what is now Pleasantville, Atlantic county. New Jersey, 
a son of Captain R. A. and Hannah (Conover) Robinson. His paternal 
grandfather resided at that place. His father, also a resident of Pleasantville. 
was a sea captain, and died at Delaware Breakwater, Pennsylvania, when 
our subject was only nine years of age. During the civil war he was drafted 
for the service but furnished a substitute. In the family were but two chil- 
dren, the daughter being Ida V.. who married Daniel B. Mason, a farmer 
and painter, bv whom she had three children, William B.. Luana W. and 
Curtis. After the death of her first husband she became the wife of Harry 
C. Barnes, a roofer by trade, but now in the employ of the fire department. 
They have two children, — Reba and Eddie. The father of our subject died 
July 26. 1 87 1, at the age of forty-two years: but the mother, who was born 
October 26, 1836, is still living. 

Mr. Robinson, of this review, attended the public schools of Atlantic 
countv until fourteen years of age. but in the months of vacation he con- 
tributed to his own support by working at anything that he could get to do. 
From the age of nine years, when his father died, he cultivated habits of in- 
dustrv and frugality and thus laid the foundation for his present creditable 
success. When a youth of fourteen he became a clerk in a dry-goods store 
in Philadelphia, but finding that occupation uncongenial he studied civil 
engineering, to which he devoted his energies for a short time. He after- 
ward learned the printer's trade, entering upon his apprenticeship in the 
office of the Banner, of Beverly, New Jersey. He later accepted a position 
in the employ of A. L. English, of the Atlantic Review, at Atlantic City. 
and continued in his service for six years. During that time he was the edi- 
tor and manager of the May's Landing Record and the assistant editor of 
the Philadelphia Journal Over the Mountains and Down by the Sea. In 
1885 he came to Ocean City to accept the position of editor of the Sentinel, 
and in July of that year, in connection with W. H. Fenton, he purchased 
that paper. In October of the same year he bought his partner's interest 
and has since been sole proprietor.

for such a pul)lication. It is called the Ocean City Daily Reporter. The 
Sentinel is a Republican sheet of four pages, of eight columns each, and the 
newspaper plant is complete in all its appointments, being equipped with 
Cottrell & Sons' presses and Gordon job presses. The papers which he 
issues are neat and attractive in appearance, and their entertaining reading 
matter has been the means of bringing to him a large and constantly increas- 
ing business. Their extensive circulation makes them a good advertising 
medium, and this branch of the business therefore adds materially to the 
income of the editor and proprietor. 

Mr. Robinson also owns considerable real estate in Ocean City and has 
been engaged in the purchase and sale of property as an investment since 1893. 
He is also an insurance agent, representing the Norwich Union and the Ger- 
man-American companies. His political support is unwaveringly given to 
the Republican party, and he does all in his power to promote its growth 
and insure its success. In 1888 he was elected a freeholder from Ocean City, 
but the following year resigned in order to accept the position of postmaster, 
to which he was appointed by President Harrison, and he held- this office for 
four and a half years. In November, 1893, he was elected one of the cor- 
oners of Cape ]May county for a term of three years, and upon the incorpora- 
tion of Ocean City as a city he was selected the superintendent and secretary 
of the board of education, and has served in the latter capacity continuously 
since. He has always been a warm friend of the public schools, laboring ear- 
nestly and effectively in their behalf. He is also a member of the Ocean City 
volunteer fire department. 

On the 8th of November, 1888, Mr. Robinson was united in marriage to 
Miss Addel Corson, a daughter of Youngs Corson, a flour and feed merchant 
and real-estate dealer of Ocean City: and to them was born a son. Richard 
S.. but they lost the little one in infancy. Of various fraternal organiza- 
tions Mr. Robinson is a representative, holding membership in Ocean Cit}' 
Lodge, No. 171, F. & A. M.; Iota Council. No. 126. J. O. U. A. M.; and 
Ocean City Council. No. 10, Daughters of America, a branch of the Junior 
Order of United American Mechanics. He was also at one time a member 
of the Red Men. A member of the Methodist Episcopal church, he has long 
served on its board of trustees, and was its president for several years. It 
is the character of the man which determines his position in life; and that 
Mr. Robinson is regarded as one of the leading and influential citizens of 
Ocean City is due to the principles which permeate his life and control his 
actions. He is a man of sterling worth, well worthy the uniform confidence 
which his friends have in him.

ALEXANDER B. HEWES. 

The firm of Hewes & Alitchell holds an important place in the business 
interests of SAvedesboro. these gentlemen being proprietors of the large grist 
and saw mill at that place. The senior member of the firm was born in 
Woolwich township, Gloucester county. January 10, 1858, and is a son of 
Thomas B. and Rebecca (Black) Hewes. The father, who was also bom in 
Gloucester county, was a carpenter by trade, but for many years before his 
death was successfully engaged in agricultural pursuits. He was a stanch 
Republican, and a man who stood high in his community. He died Decem- 
ber 2. 1897. at the age of eighty-one years, his wife surviving him until the 
spring of 1899. when she passed away, aged eighty-three years. The family 
of this wonhv couple comprised nine children, as follows: Marietta, who

many years after arriving at manhood he carried on farming to a large extent. 
In 1897, m company with George B. Mitchell, he purchased the grist and 
saw mill at Swedesboro. This mill was built in 1757, and was once owned 
and operated for a number of years by ex-Governor Stratton. Since coming 
into the hands of Hewes & ^^litchell it has been thoroughly refitted and 
supplied with modern machinery, and turns out excellent work. Its water 
power equals eighty-horse power and its steam power is sixty-horse power, 
and besides nmning the mill supplies power for the Swedesboro electric- 
light plant. The property includes considerable land adjoining the mill, and 
also a strip embracing water privileges for some distance up the coun-

LAWRENCE LOCKE. 

Long years of active business sliould he followed by an honored retire- 
ment from labor that one may enjoy the fruits of former toil and the rest that 
is truly earned. Mr. Locke is one to whom this has been vouchsafed, and 
to-day he is numbered among the respected and retired farmers of Woolwich 
township, Gloucester county. He was born April 8. 1820. on the farm which 
is now owned by George M. Hall, and is a son of John S. and Hannah (Tay- 
lor) Locke. His father was a native of Woolwich township, Gloucester 
county, where he followed farming throughout his entire life, and was a 
colonel of militia during the days that military organization had existence. 
The paternal grandparents of Mr. Locke were Jonas and Sarah (Sparks) 
Locke. The former was born March 8, 1757, the latter May 3. 1762. and 
their marriage was celebrated March 3, 1783. Their children were as fol-

20, 1794, and died October 11, 1798: and Sarah Ann, who was born June i, 
1800, and married Thomas Piatt. 

John S. Locke, the father of our suljject, de\-oted his energies to agricul- 
tural pursuits, and arriving at the years of maturity he married Miss Hannah 
Taylor, a daughter of Samuel and Naomi (Fisher) Taylor, who died Sep- 
tember 23, 1798, and January 12, 1842, respectively. After the death of her 
first husband Mr. Taylor married a Mr. Miller. Her father was a captain 
in the Revolutionary war and owned a large tract of land lying between 
Swedesboro and the Delaware river. L'nto John S. and Hannah (Taylor) 
Locke were born the following children: Joseph H., who was born Septem- 
ber 18, 1814, and died in St. Louis, Missouri; Samuel T., who was born Feb- 
ruary 23, 1817, and died at Tom's River, New Jersey; Sarah E., who was

Mr. Locke, of this review, was educated in the common schools in his 
native township and assisted his father on the home farm until twenty-five 
years of age, when he began the operation of one of his father's farms, near 
Repaupo, and cultivated this tract for three years. He then went to Louis- 
ton, Pennsylvania, where he engaged in the poultry l>usiness for six months, 
after which he returned to the old homestead, where he farmed for nine 
years. He then removed to Hardingville, New Jersey, where lie carried on 
agricultural pursuits for six years, and in 1865 he purchased his present farm 
of eighty-five acres, near the drawbridge on Raccoon creek, below Swedes- 
boro. Li 1876 he built his residence, and all of the other buildings upon the 
place stand as monuments to his thrift and enterprise. His progressive farm- 
ing methods, his unfaltering energy and his capable management brought 
to him success, which now enables him to live retired. 

Mr. Locke was married on the 17th of March, 1847, to Miss Anna Mariah 
Paul, a daughter of Adrian Paul, of Paulsboro. She died in March, 1879. In 
their family were six children: Anna, who became the wife of William String 
and died at the age of thirty-three years; Mariah, Howard V., who now oper- 
ates his father's farm; Adrian, of Swedesboro; John, who was killed by a train 
at Salt Lake City; and Emma. Mr. Locke and his family are members of 
Trinity Episcopal church, of Swedesboro, of which he has been for many years 
a vestryman. He is a Republican in politics and was a member of the New 
Jersey legislature in 1877, 1878 and 1879. On the expiration of his term he 
declined a re-election, although his official service was such that his constitu- 
ents v\-ished to return him to the office. He has served as a member of the 
township committee of Clayton township and has been the surveyor of high- 
ways in the township where he now makes his home. For long years he has 
been regarded as one of the leading and influential citizens of the community, 
for his opinions on matters of public moment are usually characterized by 
calm deliberation and sound judgment and colored by marked loyalty to the 
public good. He is now well aflvanced in years, ha\-ing almost reached the 
eightieth annual milestone in life's journev, and in the evening of life he is 
crowned with the veneration and respect which should ever l)e accorded an 
honorable old age. 



HENRY PANCOAST. 



Henrv Pancoast resides in \\'oolwich township, Gloucester countv. upon 
a farm which he has made his home since 1890. The place comprises ninety- 
five acres of arable land, the greater part of which is under a high state of 
cultivation and therefore indicates to the passers-l.iy the enterprising and 



450 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

progressive spirit of tlie owner. Tlie farm is improved witli excellent and 
substantial buildings which stand as monuments to his l)usiness ability and 
skill. Though he began life empty-handed, he has overcome all the difificul- 
ties and obstacles in the road to success and to-day is accounted one of the 
prosperous residents of this community. 

Henry Pancoast is a native of Pilesgrove township, Salem county. New 
Jersey, his birth having occurred on the 28th of November, 1843, He is 
the eldest of the seven children of Charles and Elizabeth (Hackney) Pancoast. 
also natives of Salem county, and is a cousin of Edward Pancoast, who was 
a farmer in that county. His brothers and sisters are Hannah, the wife of 
Charles Pierpont, of Salem, New Jersey; Joseph, a farmer of Camden county; 
Elizal^eth, the wife of Allen Hedley, of Swedesboro: Sarah; Isaac, a farmer 
of Clavton, New Jersev: and Charles, who is engaged in the bakery sup])ly 
business in Philadelphia. 

Henry Pancoast was educated in what was then known as Dutchtown, 
now Poplar Grove, school in \Voolwich township, Gloucester county, for 
although born in Salem county he came to Gloucester at the age of eleven 
years to make his home with Benjamin Owen. He further pursued his edu- 
cation in a private school in Woodstown and then put iiis knowledge to a 
practical test on a farm. Throughout his business career he has carried on 
agricultural pursuits and his property is one of the best developed famis in 
southern New Jersey. 

On the loth of March, 1875, Mr. Pancoast was united in marriage to 
Miss Martha, a daughter of David Warrington, of Burlington county, New 
Jersey, and they have two children, — B. Owen and Ethelda Pancoast, — who 
are still at their parental home. Mr. Pancoast is a member of the Swedes- 
boro Grange and has served on the school board, yet has never been an office- 
seeker, content to devote his energies to business interests. 



CAPTAIN CHARLES P. LORD. 

Captain Charles Phineas Lord, the mayor of Vineland, New Jersey, was 
born in the town of North Berwick, Maine, October 14. 1831. His earliest 
American ancestor was Nathan Lord, who settleil in South Berwick, that 
state, in 1632. Thus it happens that the family has for more than two and a 
half centuries been associated with the local history and tradition of the old 
town. Humphrey Lord, the grandfather of Charles P. Lord, lived at Old 
Fields, South Berwick; and it seems a singular fact that the generations of 
this famil\- remained for so long a period in the same region of the country. 



COXGRESSfOXAL DISTRICT OF XRW JERSEY. 451 

Here also Jeremiah Lord, the father of Vineland's mayor, was bom. Tie 
was a general merchant in North Berwick up to the time of his death, which 
occurred in 1862. Though an ardent Whig, and a stanch Republican after 
the formation of the latter party, he was never an aspirant for any office 
in his town or county. 

Jeremiah Lord married Miss Mavy Ann Varney, of Rochester. New- 
Hampshire, the daughter of Phineas \'arney, the representative of a promi- 
nent New England family. Mrs. Lord, who was born in 1809 and has wit- 
nessed many changes in her long life, still survives her husband. Charles 
Phineas was the eldestd)orn of her nine children. The eight brothers and 
sisters were respectively: Albert J., of Charlestown, Massachusetts: Henry 
\V., who died: Sarah J., who lives at the old home; Sophia, who died of 
small-pox, contracted during the war liy coming in contact with some 
"Rebel" clothin.o- sent into Boston, presumably with the object of spreading 
the horrible disease; an infant who died without a name; Mary Ann, who 
died; Jeremiah E. and John R.. both residents of North Berwick. The 
parents were both in church fellowship, the mother being a Congregation- 
alist, while the father was a Universalist. Jeremiah Lord was a cousin of 
Miss Sarah Orne Jewett, the popular writer whose stories of New England 
life have made the old town of South Berwick and the surrounding country 
so full of interest to her readers. 

Charles P. Lord was educated in the grammar school of North Berwick 
and at Lowell, Massachusetts. Directly after his graduation at the North 
Berwick high school he became a clerk in a store, where he remained until 
eighteen years of age. Going then to Lowell, he served an apprenticeship 
of three toilsome years in acquiring proficiency in the machinist's trade. 
This calling he followed until the breaking out of the civil war, when he 
enlisted in a company of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry known as the 
Lowell Mechanics' Phalanx. He had joined the Phalanx, which was a state 
militia organization, in his youth, and had served his full term, receiving- 
honorable discharge from duty. Part of the time while thus engaged he 
served as a sergeant and company clerk. At the time of President Lincoln's 
inauguration, when portentous war clouds hung over the political heavens, 
Sergeant Lord rejoined his company: and wisely, too, for the Mechanics' 
Phalanx was destined to take a prominent part in the national struggle soon 
to follow. Foreseeing the needs of the situation, Charles P. Lord made a 
motion that very evening to tender, the services of the Phalanx to the 
government. As the result of this action a meeting of the officers of the 
Sixth Regiment was held January 21. 1861. and an offer of the regiment 
made to the commander in chief of the state. This resolution was carried 



452 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

to Boston by General Bntler, who was at that time a member of the IMassa- 
chusetts state senate. The legislature of Massachusetts now tendered tlie 
services of the state troops to the government, and active life began for tlie 
men. who were soon to be soldiers in good earnest, although even before 
Lincoln's inauguration the company had been drilling. Senator Wilson, of 
Massachusetts, was in Washington when the first call for troops was made, 
on the 15th of April, 1861. About four hours previous to the issue of the 
proclamation President Lincoln had requested Mr. Wilson to have four regi- 
ments of Massachusetts militia sent to Waslijngton on duty. The Sixth 
was now ordered to muster on Boston Common preparatory to marshaling 
their ranks for a march to the national capital. The men of the Phalanx 
had very soon after an actual experience of A\arfare, for they had to fight 
their way through Baltimore in the memorable secession riot of April ig, 
1861. The Sixth was mustered with the United States service, and was 
quartered in the senate chamber for about ten days, after which they were 
ordered from Washington to the Relay House. 

After doing duty in this vicinity for about three months, Sergeant Lord 
returned to Massachusetts, and in August, 1861, enlisted in Companj- F, the 
Eighth Maine. As first sergeant he went to Washington and Annapolis, 
and was a participant in the battles of Port Royal, Jacksonville, Florida: the 
siege of Charleston, and the capture of Pulaski. It was while at Port Royal 
with Sherman that he was promoted to the second and first lieutenancy, the 
last oiifice carrying with it the acting capacity of a captaincy, as his papers 
read "First Lieutenant Commanding Company." While participating in en- 
gagements mentioned above, Captain Lord was also doing guard and pro- 
vost duty until he joined the Army of the Potomac under General Grant. 
His health began to fail under the strain of army life, and, after being detailed 
with forty men to cut a way through the malarial southern swamps, he be- 
came physically disabled, and was discharged from active service.' The 
three weeks' work in the swampy lowlands was accomplished at a great cost. 
Only six men out of the forty who had made the party survived. 

On the 22d of February, 1866, Captain Lord came to Vineland, where 
he purchased a farm ; but he was too shattered in health to bear the strain of 
such exertions as a successful farmer must endure, and was compelled to 
give it up. For a number of years he was the head clerk in the grocery of 
Brown & Lorin; but even that occupation proved too much for his enfeebled 
constitution, and he resigned the position. Finding himself in a measure re- 
cuperated after a complete rest, he entered the arena of public life, and in 
1877 was elected the mayor of Vineland. He filled the office seven one-year 
terms, and in 1895 was re-elected for a term of three years. During his ad-

COLEMAN F. LEAMING, JR. 

Honoretl and respected l)v all, there is no man in Cape May county who 
occupies a more enviable position in financial circles than J. Coleman Leani' 
ing, of South Dennis, not alone on account of the brilliant success he has 
achieved but also on account of the honorable, straightforward business pol- 
icy he has ever followed. He possesses untiring energy, is quick of percep- 
tion, forms his plans readily and is determined in their execution; and his 
close application to business and excellent management have brought to him 
the degree of prosperity wdiich is to-day his, and which now enables him to 
live a retired life. It is true that he became interested in a business already 
established, but in controlling and enlarging such an enterprise many a man 
of even considerable resolute purpose, courage and industr}- would have 
failed; and he has demonstrated the truth of the saying that success is not a 
matter of genius but the outcome of a clear judgment and experience. 

Mr. Leaming is a native of South Dennis and a son of Richard S. and 
Amelia (Ludlum) Leaming. His great-grandfather. Persons Leaming, was 
a son of -Aaron and Mary Leaming, and after attaining his majority he mar- 
ried Charlotte Eldredge, a daughter of Aaron Eldredge. They became the 
parents of seven children: Aaron. Furman, Mary, Persons, Jeremiah. James 
Ranev anrl Charlotte. Jercniiah Leamins'. the grandfather of our subject.

education, which was supplemented by study in an academy at Woodbury 
through one term. At the age of sixteen, however, he put aside his text 
1)ooks to engage in farming on his own account, and throughout his entire life 
he was identified with the agricultural interests of Cape May county. He 
also became an extensive dealer in cedar lumber, purchasing land from 
which he has cut the timber, and then in his own saw and planing-mill trans- 
forming it into finished lumber. He owned large tracts of swamp land on 
JDennis creek and Tuckahoe river and did a very large and profitable busi- 
ness. Later he became engaged in ship-building on Dennis creek and was 
one of the leading representatives of that industry in this part of the county. 
He built a schooner at Dorchester, New Jersey, and also built there the bark- 
entine which was lost with all its crew on its first trip, when carrying a cargo 
of grain from Philadelphia to Lisbon. Mr. Learning also built many other 
vessels, including the Susan F. Abbott, Amelia H. Leaming, Ella Mathew, 
C. B. Wood, J. K. Manning, William L. Elkins, the schooner Frank Leam- 
ing, the Providence, the William E. Lee, Sallie Young, William L. Abbott, 
John B. Adams, Richard S. Leaming, Gertrude Abbott, Isaac H. Tilyier, 
Lizzie Babcock, Thomas F. Pollard, Douglas Gregory and John M. Moore. 
In all of these he retained a one-fourth or three-eighths interest. Many of 
the first vessels w-hich he constructed are still in use, which indicates the 
superiority of the workmanship and of the materials used in their building. 
Mr. Leaming also dealt extensively in cord-wood and had over one thousand 
cords on hand at the time of his death. His farming property in Cape May 
county aggregated four hundred acres of land, and returned to him a good 
income. He was a man of great industry, of determined purpose and of 
sound judgment, and carried foi-ward to successful completion whatever he 
undertook. Charitable and benevolent, he gave freely of his means to various 
organizations and was very generous to the poor and needy, but most he 
believed in that practical charity which furnishes employment to those who 
need it and thus enables a man to help himself and retain his self-respect. A 
stanch Republican, he was prominent in the councils of his party and was 
very earnest in his advocacy of its principles. For eight years he served as 
a member of the board of freeholders, and in 1870 he was elected a member 
of the general assembly, serving during the sessions of 1871, 187J and 1873. 
He received large majorities, polling an especially large \ote at the election 
of 1873. a fact which indicated his personal popularity and the confidence 
reposed in him by his fellow townsmen. Elected to the senate, he was a 



COXGRESSIOX.^L DISTRICT OF NEIV JERSEY. 457 

recognized leader of the Republican forces in the upper house, and in 1876 
he was made a delegate to the national convention which nominated Ruther- 
ford B Hayes for the presidency. During the civil war he was appointed 
by the board of freeholders as paymaster to pay bounties to the soldiers who 
had gone to the front. 

Although his business interests were very extensive and his otScial duties 
varied and responsible, Mr. Learning yet found time to devote to the holier 
duties of life which concern man's relation to his fellow man and to his 
Maker. He held membership in the Memorial Baptist church, of South 
;Dennis, was the president of the board of trustees and treasurer of the 
church, and largely through his efforts the church organization was con- 
tinued. He organized the Sunday-school, served as its superintendent for 
many years and was instrumental in bringing many young people into the 
church, a number of whom are now devoting their lives to Christian work 
as representatives of the ministry. Not only by precept but by example did 
he tell his fellow men of the principles of Christianity, for his life was ever 
upright and honorable, his manner kindly and his dealings just. He was mar- 
ried, December 8, 1849, to Amelia Ludlum, a daughter of Jeremiah and 
Emma Ludlum, and three children were born to them: Emma L., who was 
born Deceml)er 13, 1851, and died December 31. of the same year; Coleman 
F.; and Frank, who was born March 10, 1857, is identified with the farming 
interests of Middle township, Cape May county, and was married February 
9, 1888, to Anna Edwards, a daughter of Lewis and Abbie Edwards. The 
father of these children died May 25, 1895, and on the 8th of November of 
the same year the inother was called to her final rest. 

Coleman F. Leaming, Jr., whose name introduces this review, pursued 
his education in the public schools, and also attended boarding schools in 
Vineland and in Cape May Court House. At a comparatively early age, 
however, he put aside his text-books, as his father needed his services in the 
management and control of his extensive business interests. The relation 
between father and son in their industrial and commercial interests continued 
until the death of the fonner, the enterprise and progressive spirit of the 
younger man forming an excellent complement to the experience and ma- 
ture judgment of the elder. Our subject had charge of the work of securing 
the materials for ship-building and he worked upon the greater number of 
the vessels mentioned above. They abandoned their business in that line of 
industrial labor in 1892, when the father retired to private life, for the sail- 
boats had been succeeded by barges for the carrying trade. Mr. Leaming is 
also living retired save for the demands made upon his time and attention by 
his investments. The capital which he acquired in former years had been used 



458 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

in the purchase of real estate and personal property, which i^rings to him a 
handsome income. He is also interested in a number of boats. 

On the 6th of July, 1878, Mr. Learning was united in marriage to Miss 
Huldah Cresse, a daughter of Lewis Cresse, who was a farmer of Cape May 
county, and they now have two children: Richard S., who was born Febru- 
ary 17. 1882, and is now a student in the Lawrenceville Preparatory school: 
and Lewis C, who was born November 13, 1883, and is at home. The famil\- 
attend the Baptist church, of which Mr. Learning is a leading member. He 
is serving as its treasurer and as a member of the board of trustees, and his 
liberal contributions and effective labors have resulted greatly to the benefit 
of the organization. His political support is given the Republican party, 
but he has never 1)een an aspirant for public ofifice, preferring to devote his 
time to the management of his business interests. The career of Mr. Learn- 
ing has ever been such as to warrant the trust and confidence of the business 
world, for he has ever conducted all transactions on the strictest principles 
of integrity and honor. His devotion to the public good is unquestioned and 
arises from a sincere interest in the welfare of his fellow men. Helpfulness 
may well be termed a keynote of his character, anrl in all circles of society it 
has won him admiration and regard. 



HANCE HELMS. 



( 



Hance Helms was born in Bridgeport, New Jersey, May 20, 1849. and is 
a son of James E. Helms, wdio resides near Repaupo. He was educated in 
the public schools of Logan township, in Gibbstown, Penn Grove and in 
Wyoming Seminary of Kingston, Pennsylvania, and then engaged in teach- 
ing in the Repaupo school, where he continued as assistant for four years, 
and for eight months held the position of principal of the Gibbstown school. 
On the expiration of that period, however, he began farming, which he has 
since followed. For eight years he was engaged in the cultivation of a farm 
near Swedesboro. Since 1882 he has occupied his present farm of one hun- 
dred and sixteen acres, which property belongs to his father. He is an 
enterprising agriculturist, and his well tilled fields yield to him a golden trib- 
ute in return for the care and labor he bestows upon them. 

On the 13th of November. 1873. Mr. Helms was united in marriage to 
Miss Emily Thompson, daughter of Uriah Thompson, who resided in Logan 
township. She died March 4. 1898. leaving two children. George Horton 
and Gertrude T. ^Ir. Helms is a member of the Bridgeport Methodist 
Episcopal church and his life is in harmony with his professions. He is a

valued representative of several civic societies, is past grand of the Inde- 
pendent Order of Odd Fellows, past master of the Ancient Order of United 
Workmen, of Bridgeport, and is a member of the Swedesboro Grange. He 
exercises his right of franchise in support of the men and measures of the 
Democratic party, and for twelve years has l)een a member of the township 
committee, doing all in his power to promote the growth and insure the suc- 
cess of that organization. In the active afifairs of life he is meeting with fair 
success, and among his characteristics is numbered that of industr)-. which 
never fails to bring its sure reward. 



CHARLES P. BATTEN. 

The ancestral history of this gentleman is one of long connection with 
the agricultural interests of New Jersey. The family was founded in America 
by Sir Francis Batten, who came from England in the early part of the eight- 
eenth centurv and took up a large tract of land in Woolwich township, com- 
prising the farm now owned by the subject of this review. He has in his 
possession an old-fashioned cow-bell, on which is the name F. Batten, and 
which is thought to have belonged to Sir Francis Batten, who was the great- 
great-grandfather of our subject. His son. Thomas Batten, married Jane 
Ann Scott, and their son, Joseph Batten, was the father of John Batten, 
the last named being the father of our subject. He married Susan Zern. 
and as a means of livelihood followed the occupation of farming. His death 
occurred March 17. 1864. and his wife passed away May 18. 1883. They 
were the parents of two children. — Charles Paul and Sarah A.. — the latter 
the wife of Joshua Haines, who is now living retired in Philadelphia and who 
has two children. — John and Claude. 

Mr. Batten, of this review, spent his boyhood days on the farm, and the 
public schools afforded him the educational privileges he enjoyed. The year 
following his father's death he purchased the old homestead farm which has 
been in the possession of the family for almost two centuries. Since that 
time he has cultivated his land with excellent success, and has replaced nearly 
all of the old buildings with attractive and substantial new structures. He 
erected his present residence in 1880. and in many ways has added to the 
beauty and utility of his farm. 

Mr. Batten is a man of broad general information, and throughout his 
life has been \erv fond of reading and has also added to his store of knowledge 
bv travel in Mexico and the United States, gaining thereby information 
which can never be gleaned from books and which adds a most attractive 



46o BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

element to his conversation. In politics he is a Democrat, and from 1871 
until 1895 ser\-ed as a member of the township committee. In 1897 he was 
re-elected to the position and is now chairman of the committee. .\11 his 
life he has resided in Gloucester county, and his many excellencies of char- 
acter have gained him the warm regard of those who have known him from 
boyhood and those whom he has met in later vears. 



TORN P. SHEPPARD. 



John Plummer Sheppard is a worthy representative of one of the oldest 
and most honorable families in Salem county. The old homestead on which 
he was bom has been in the possession of the Sheppard family for more than 
one hundred and fifty years, and now belongs to John P. and his brother 
Sylvanus, who could not be persuaded for any consideration to part with it. 

Long before the Revolutionary war there came from Ireland John Fitz- 
patrick, who purchased fifteen hundred acres of land and established his 
home in Lower Alloway Creek township. His son Samuel continued to dwell 
on the place, where he reared six sons and a daughter. This daughter mar- 
ried Sylvanus Sheppard, who came to the homestead in 1781, the year of his 
marriage, where he lived until 1824. 

His connection with the early Baptist church at Camden gives us occa- 
sion for the relation of an interesting item in general history- here. The 
third church building erected in Camden was that of the Baptists, in 18 18. 
In 1809 and 1810 a few Baptist families had settled in Camden from the 
Cohansey and Salem churches and united with the First Baptist church of 
Philadelphia. Every Sunday, in order to attend worship, they crossed the 
river in row-boats. During one winter, however, the ice on the river was so 
strong for thirteen weeks that these faithful worshipers were enabled to walk 
across the river. In 1818 seven members of the First Baptist church in Phila- 
delphia were dismissed by letter to the First Baptist church in Camden. 
These were Sylvanus Sheppard. mentioned in the preceding paragraph; 
Phebe, his wife, Richard Johnson, Ann Johnson, Isaac Smith, Hannah Lud- 
1am and Eleanor Sheppard. Most of these names have since been celebrated 
in Salem county history. This Baptist church has been the parent of all the 
other Baptist churches in Camden. The first trustees included Sylvanus 
Sheppard, Reuben Ludlam and Isaac Smith, w hile Mr. Sheppard and Richard 
Johnson were deacons. 

In 1789 Enoch Sheppard was Ijorn, a son of Sylvanus, and he passed 
his entire life on the homestead. He was the paternal grandfather of the

.ubiect of our sketch, and was a man of unusual ability in music, and not 
onl luoht it to others but also for many years was the leader ot the cho.r 
h Snton Baptist church. He married Miss Mary Hancock and U.ree 
children were born to them: John H., Phoebe Barker and Ehzabeth Ddks^ 
Tie birth of John H. Sheppard took place on the old homestead m 1830 and 
there he spent his entire life in agricultural pursuits. He was a man of im- 
portance the communitv and was entrusted with many local othces. Poht- 
Tan he was identified with the Democratic party, but not ben.g a polm- 
cian he refused to accept any offices except such as were of local interest. He 
as for manv vears an active member of the Canton Baptist church where 
he was loved and honored by the membership whom he was called to lead 
in many responsible duties. His highly useful and happy career was brought 
;o a close on the tSth of November. 1891. when his church and comnuimty 
realized that they had lost a valuable friend and member. His wife, ^^hose 
maiden name was Eleanor Plummer. is still living, and is approaching the 
eightieth anniversary of her birth. She is the mother of three children : S> 1- 
vamis. who is a merchant in Quinton; John P.; and Ehzabeth the wife of 
Rev Tames Dare, of the Methodist Episcopal church, who died m 188,. 

John Plummer Sheppard was born December 10, 1852, and received a 
public-school education in the little school-house at ^'^ -°---^^ "-j;^;;; 
home, which was completed in the schools in Salem. When he was abou^ 
eighteen vears of age he began to earn his own living, at hrst by worku g 
wfth his father at home, then going into the woods to cut timber, and then 
entering a store as clerk. But he could not be satisfied with the prospect 
of ..ain this held out to him. and having practiced rigid economy, he amassed 
a sum of monev sufficient to enable him to open a countrv store on ns own 
account at Canton. Here he endeavored to meet all the wants of the com- 
munitv and made a specialty of fertilizers, agricultural implements, coal, and 
the usual stock, of a country warehouse. In addition he started a canning 
factory, which at first employed fifty hands, and increased until one bundled 
and f^'ftv persons were working within it. ,,,,.,, 1 ^f 

\t ihe end of fourteen vears Mr. Sheppard concluded that the la.k of 
railroad facilities and contact with the outside world prevented Inm from 
having the access he craved at his old home, and he i^moved to Salem 
where he started the mill now known far and near as the Salem kmttmg 
Mills This has become under his management one of the most thriving 
mdustries in southern New Jersey. Mr. Sheppard built a substantial factory 
fiftv-seven feet wide, ninety-seven feet long and three stones m height, in 
which at the numerous looms, from one hundred and ten to one hundred 
and fo'rtv-iive people are to be seen daily working cheerfully at their special

ta'iks. The traveling salesmen employed have placed the goods manufac- 
tured by Air. Sheppard in every part of the United States, and the Ijiisiness 
has so increased that sometimes it has been necessary to run the factory night 
and day to fill the required orders. The industry is of untold benefit to 
Salem, as it affords employment to many of the better class of employes who 
would otherwise find it difficult to obtain suitable employment. Mr. Shep- 
pard is appreciated by his fellow citizens and they rejoice in his success, en- 
couraging him to still further extend the range of his industry. 

Mr. Sheppard is a member of the Broadway IMethodist Episcopal church, 
but his sympathies go out to all the religious organizations of his town. On 
February' 20, 1878, Mr. Sheppard married ]\Iiss Rebecca, the daughter of 
Enoch B. Garrison, of Canton, who has been a good helpmeet to her hus- 
band in his various business enterprises. Raymond Garrison .Sheppard. 
their only son, is now associated with his father in business, and by his 
integrity and energy gives promise of achie\-ing success in his career as a 
business man. 



BEN7AMIX ALLEX TYLER. 

On no other article of consumption does the health of the public depend 
to such an extent as on pure milk, as it enters largely into all our food and the 
children of many families find in it their principal sustenance. It is not 
always an easy matter to procure this article in its best st^te, as man\' families 
can testify, and the man who endeavors to put a first-class article on the 
market is sure to find a ready sale, as does the gentleman wdiose name appears 
abo\e. He realizes the needs of his patrons and endeavors to meet them, 
while they appreciate his efforts by their high praises and steadily increas- 
ing patronage. He is a son of John and Beulah (Griscom) Tyler, and was 
born in Cumberland county, this state, in the township of Greenwich, Octo- 
ber 23, 1837. 

Benjamin Tyler, the grandfather, owned two farms in Greenwich town- 
ship, and was a man of considerable means. He was a Whig and later a 
Republican and a member of the Society of Friends. He was married three 
times, his first wife being the grandmother of our subject. Her children 
were Hannah, who first married Josiah Harmer and then Levi Smith; John: 
Ebenezer, a farmer of Cumberland county, who married Sarah Stewart: 
Mary, who married Charles Harmer and is now in her ninetieth year: her 
second husband was Andrew Thompson; Lydia. who married Reuben Hill- 
iard: and Benjamin, who married Alice Woolman. The second and third 
marriages were without issue. Mr. Tyler lived to be seventy-six years of age. 



C0XGRESSI0X.4L DISTRICT OF XEiV JERSEY. 4^3 

John Tyler was born in Cumberland county, this state, March 7. 1808, and 
resided in his native township all his life, dying February 4. 1898. at the ad- 
vanced age of ninety years. He owned two farms and was known and re- 
spected bv every one.' He was an earnest Christian and a strict adherent of 
the Friends' church. In politics he was a Whig and when that party was sub- 
merged in the Republican party he joined forces with that organization and 
cast\is votes with them. He was married twice, his first wife being the 
mother of our subject. They were the parents of a large family of children, 
many of whom grew up and are useful, honorable citizens of their respective 
communities. Thev were as follows: Anna, the wife of Chamblin Hancock, 
a farmer of this county; John and William, both of whom died in childhood: 
Benjamin Allen, the subject of this biography; Rebecca, who first married 
William Fogg and then Amos Gardner, a farmer of Gloucester county; Mary, 
who was also twice married, her first husband being William Stokes and her 
second one Thomas Hughes, a resident of Salem; Beulah married Clement 
Acton, of Salem; Lydia is unmarried; John married twice,— first Mary 
Mulfoi-d and afterward Lucy Haines; and George, who married Martha 
Ridgeway. The mother reached her sixty-sixth year, when her family were 
called on to mourn her death, in August, 1874. 

Benjamin Allen Tvler was reared on a farm and his childhood and early 
youth was similar to that of other boys of that time. He attended the com- 
mon schools of his native township and spent his spare moments in work 
about the farm. Having a liking for the free and independent life of a 
farmer, he continued in that work and in 1873 bought a farm of one hundred 
and sixty acres in Penn's Neck, where he resided until 1895, when he moved 
to Salem. He decided to combine the dairy business with farming, believing 
that it would not only prove a source of considerable direct income but would 
also be the means of building up his farm as well, as it has now come to be 
an established fact that stock kept on a farm adds greatly to its productive 
powers, and grain fed to them brings a much better profit when sold either 
as beef, hogs or milk than when put directly on the market. His venture 
as a dairyman has been attended with the most gratifying results, as he has 
made it his aim to furnish only the best quality of milk, a fact his customers 
have not been slow to appreciate. 

March 14, i860, he was united in marriage to Miss Millicent Bosby, a 
daughter of Isaac Bosby. Four children were born to them, namely: Han- 
nah, October 12, 1863; Benjamin. July 2. 1865, who married Margaret 
Ormsby, of Philadelphia; he graduated at the Medico-Chirurgical College of 
Philadelphia, spent one year in the Medical hospital and another in the Phila- 
delphia hospital, when he located at Royersford, Pennsylvania, where he is

to Salem, where he conducted a grocery two or three years, — from 1895 to 
1898, — when he disposed of that interest and opened an office where he has 
since carried on business in fire insurance, real estate, surveying, etc. 

Mr. Miller was married October 27, 1885, to Miss Mariana E., daughter

gentleman whom it is a pleasure to meet. 



HUGHES C. SHARP. 



Success is not a matter of genius, as claimed by some, or an inherent 
talent, but comes as the natural result of well directed and continued effort. 
It is this quality which has made Mr. Sharp ane of the leading agriculturists 
of Logan township, and his prosperity is certainly well merited. He was 
born within a half mile of his present farm, on the 5th of November, 1840. 
His father, Jacob Sharp, was a native of Cumberland county. New Jersey, 
and a son of Joseph Sharp. Having arrived at years of maturity, he married 
Miss Rosanna Sheets, a daughter of George Sheets. In early life he had 
learned and followed the carpenter's trade, but during the latter part of his 
business career he devoted his energies to agricultural pursuits. His death 
occurred in 1893, when he had attained the very advanced age of ninety-six, 
and his wife passed away in 1889, at the age of eighty-six years. In their 
family were the following children: Amanda, the wife of Joseph Kidd, of 
Penn Grove township, both deceased; John, a farmer living near Mullica 
Hill: Eliza, the wddow of Samuel Stanger, of Wilmington. Delaware; Sarah, 
the widow of Chalkley Madara, of Philadelphia; Charles, the proprietor of

debted for the early educational privileges he received. He afterward pur- 
sued his studies in Philadelphia, and through the months of vacation assisted 
his father in the labors of the home farm, and to him gave the benefit of his 
services until he was twentv-three vears of age, when he began farmins: on

his own account. He cultivated rented farms for three years near Pedrick- 
town and for ten years near Bridgeport, and in 1879, liaving acquired some 
capital, purchased ninety-five acres of land, to which he has since added a 
tract of sixty-one acres, so that his farm now comprises one hundred and 
sixty-six acres. In 1887 he erected thereon a heautiful residence and in many 
ways has improved the propert}-, thus adding to its value and attractive 
appearance as well as utility. All the accessories and con\eniences of a 
model farm are here found, and the well tilled fields yield to him a good 
return for his care and lahor. 

The marriage of Mr. Sharp was celehrated in January, 1862, when Aliss 
Emma Dawson Ijecame his wife. She is a daughter of Joseph and Hannah 
(Andrews) Dawson, of Swedesl)oro, New Jersey, of which place her parents 
were both natives. ]\Ir. and Mrs. Sharp had ten children, but six of the num- 
ber died in childhood. The others are: Georgianna, the wife of Harry 
Hurff, of Camden, by whom she has one son, Aaron Hurft'; James Thomp- 
son, who occupies one of his father's farms and who married Josephine Todd, 
by whom he has a daughter. Pearl: Eva, wife of .Xndrew Wilson, of Phila- 
delphia; and Joseph Warner, who assists his father on the home farm. 

Mr. Sharp votes with the Republican party, and has served his township 
as a member of the board of school trustees. He has never been an office 
seeker, preferring to devote his time and energies to his business interests. 
He is an energetic business man of marked ability, a progressive citizen and 
justly popular among his wide circle of acquaintances. 



MATTHIAS MUHLBAIER. 

Matthias Muhlbaier is now living retired at his pleasant home in Swedes- 
boro. New Jersey, but for many years was connected with the agricultural 
interests of this state, and through his capable management and untiring 
industry has accumulated a handsome competence, having been regarded 
as one of the most successful representatives of Gloucester county. A native 
of Germany, he was born at Waldorf, Baden, on the i6th of Februarv, 1826, 
and is a son of Philip and Elizabeth (Roster) Muhlbaier. In their family 
were six children, namely: Elizabeth, the deceased wife of Jacob Burkle, of 
Bridgeport, New Jersey: Matthias; Frederick, who is still living in the 
Fatherland; Katherine, the widow of Charles Bishop and a resident of Phila- 
delphia; Eva, the widow of Charles Hess and a resident of Germanv; and 
John, who formerly made his home in Philadelphia but is now living a re- 
tired life in Glen Riddle, Pennsylvania. 



468 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Mr. ^luhlljaier. of this re\Me\v, pursued liis education in the well regulated 
schools of his native land, and being an apt student acquired a good fund of 
knowledge to tit him for the practical and responsible duties of life. He 
worked on a farm by the month in Germany until 1854. when he determined 
to seek a home in the United States, landing at New York on the 27th of 
November. He first secured employment near Peclricktown. but soon after- 
ward went to Bridgeport, where he worked by the day on Raccoon island 
through the succeeding six years. In i860 he purchased a farm of sixty 
acres between Bridgeport and Swedesboro and as time passed added to his 
property, buying at one time a tract of sixty acres, at another one hundred 
acres and later a place of thirty-three acres. These four farms are now occu- 
pied by his children. l)ut for many years he was actively associated with the 
agricultural interests and was accounted one of the most practical and pro- 
gressive farmers of the community. In February. 1898. he and his wife re- 
moved to Swedesboro, where they have since resided. Through a period 
of more than half a century Mr. Muhlbaier was a verj' hard-working man, 
and his economy, capable management and enterprise, together with the 
assistance of his devoted wife, enabled him to accumulate a handsome for- 
tune, so that they are enabled to spend the evening of life in quiet and retire- 
ment, surrounded by many comforts. 

Mrs. Muhlbaier preceded her husband to this country about six months. 
Her maiden name was Christina Schlag, and she was a daughter of Peter 
Schlag. She also is a native of Waldorf, Baden, where she became slightly 
acquainted with her inisband. It was through her brother, a friend of Mr. 
Muhlbaier. then living in Philadelphia, that the acquaintance was extended 
until stronger ties were fonned. On the 27th of November, 1855, they 
went from Bridgeport to Philadelphia and were married in St. Peter's Cathe- 
dral, of the latter city. Five children came to bless their union: Elizabeth, 
now the wife of Joseph Schmidt, a farmer of Woolwich township; Caroline, 
the wife of John Goulegowski. a farmer of Logan township, by whom she has 
three children, — Elizabeth, the wife of Matthew Groppenbecher, Mary and 
Philip: Lena, the wife of ]\Iartin Shorn, an agriculturist of Woolwich town- 
ship. l>v whom she has four children. — Joseph, Christina, Florentine and 
John: Philip, who owns the old homestead, and married Miss Mary Laux, 
by whom he has four children. — Matthias and Sebastian, (twins), Walter and 
Clarence: and Peter, a farmer of Logan township, who married Elizabeth 
Woelk, of Philadelphia, and has a son, named Edward. 

Mr. Muhlbaier and his family are well devoted members of St. Joseph's 
Catholic church, of Swedesboro. and contribute liberally to its support. He was 
one of the earliest representati\'es of that denomination who located in that 



COXGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEJV JERSEY. 469 

section of Gloucester county and frequently walked from Raccoon island to 
the home of Daniel Kenney, south of Swedesboro. in order to attend mass, 
which was occasionally celebrated there by a priest from Salem. When the 
erection of the first church in Swedesboro was undertaken he was the largest 
contributor to the enterprise, the amount which he gave being five dollars, — 
at that time being considered a very large sum. Mr. Muhlbaier has always 
taken a deep interest in everything pertaining to the welfare of the commun- 
ity and has given his political support to the Democratic party. He came 
to this country a poor man, dejjendent upon each day's toil for the means 
of livelihood, and without even a knowledge of the English language. By 
persistence in his work, economy and fair dealing he has steadily advanced 
and his life indicates most clearly the opportunities which are afforded the 
ambitious young man in this free republic. 



SAMUEL M. PARKER. 

For many years Samuel Matlack Parker, who is now deceased, was con- 
nectecl with the agricultural interests of Gloucester county, owning and 
culti\-ating a fine farm in Woolwich township. He was born in Haddonfield,

470 



BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



and influential citizens of his community. In business he was a man of re- 
sourceful ability, w ho carried forward to successful completion whatever he 
undertook. For a time he ran the steamboat Falcon from Swedesboro to 
Philadelphia, and after six years spent in that way purchased and occupied 
a farm near Swedesboro. He owned that property until his death and was 
very successful in its cultivation. In 1893 he removed to Swedesboro, where 
he occupied a well appointed home, spending- the last few years of his hfe 
in an honored retirement from labor save the management of his property 
interests. 

On the 31st of October. 1861, Mr. Parker was united in marriage to Miss 
Sarah Eastlack, a daughter of Samuel Eastlack of Timerereek, Gloucester 
county. They became the parents of six children, but Katie S. and Harry

— Marion G.. Sarah F., Alberta S. and Howard S. ; S. Russel, who married 
Emma Adams and has a son, Harry R.; and Gertrude S., who completes 
the famil}-. 

Mr. Parker was a charter member of the Swedesboro Grange and in his 
political affiliations was a Republican, who firmly upheld the principles of 
the party and filled a number of local public ofifices with credit to himself 
and satisfaction to his constituents. He passed away July 24. 1899, and in 
his death the community lost one of its representative and honored men. 
He was always reliable in business, faithful to his duties of citizenship and 
to the home, and his sterling worth commanded the respect of all with whom 
he came in contact. The family attend the Trinity Episcopal church and 
are highly esteemed in \A'oohvich townshi]). 



ISAIAH S. ALDERMAN. 

This progressive and substantial agriciUturist of Gloucester county was 
born October 31, 1847, i" Pittsgrove township, Salem county. New Jersey, 
and was reared there. His father, John Alderman, was a son of Joim Alder- 
man. After the death of the last mentioned his widow moved to Pittsgro\e 
from their old home at W'oodstown, and her support was greatly aided by the 
willing hands of her son John, the father of our suliject. She passed the 
most of the remainder of her life there, dying, however, at Woodstown. 
John was a farmer by occupation and was esteemed as an honorable, upright 
man. The man\' offices of trust to which he was chosen showed the conli- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEIC JERSEY. 471 

dence reposed in him, while the careful and conscientious discharge of the 
duties thus imposed evinced the general character of the man. He was a 
member of the Presbyterian church and was a member of the committee who 
Inhlt the present church edifice at Pittsgrove. He married Miss Anna Strat- 
ton, by whom he had four children, namely: 01i\'er. who resides on the 
Pittsgrove homestead: Isaiah S., whose name heads this sketch; Anna, the 
wife of Dr. J. E. Jac|uett, of Woodstown: and Sarah, who became the 
wife of William Sellers, the proprietor of the iron works near Wilmington. 
Delaware. Mr. Alderman survived his wife some years, dying in 1893, at 
tlie close of a long and useful life. 

I. S. Alderman received a common-school education and was for a short 
time a pupil at the state school at Trenton. He spent four years with his 
brother Oliver at Woodstown, in the store which had lieen opened by their 
father some time previously. In 1883 he moved to his present location, 
where he owns a fine farm and has de\'oted his attention to agriculture. Mr. 
and Mrs. Alderman ha\e considerable landed interests in this vicinity and in 
Salem county. They both take an active interest in all questions that afifect 
the farmer, and he is a memlier of the Grange. The\- are closel\- identified 
with the Presbyterian church. 

As his companion throughout life Mr. Alderman chose Miss Mary Wilson, 
to whom he was joined in matrimony March 29, 1883, and the names of 
their children are Elizabeth, John and Anna. Robert Wilson, the father of 
Mrs. Alderman, was born in 1809, in county Antriqi, Ireland, and came to 
America when a young man, with no capital but a stout heart and willing 
hands. He was industrious and economical and soon had a neat sum saved 
up. which was deposited in the bank for safe keeping. The bank failed, and 
he, with hundreds of others, were in a day's time defrauded of money which 
represented years of toil and privation. Still hopeful for the future, he once 
more bent his energies to his task and again saved his earnings until he had 
a goodly sum; but this time he profited by his previous lesson and purchased 
large tracts of timber land and engaged in making charcoal. He operated 
a sawmill at Fries' Mill, and engaged in farming and lumbering, soon acciuir- 
ing a large property and becoming one of the foremost men of his day. 
He was a strict churchman, an elder of the Presbyterian church and a trustee 
for many years. His wife, whose maiden name was Elizabeth McCaughan, 
was a native of the same place as was he, and her demise occurred in 1872. 
He survi\ed her nine years, when he, too, laid down the burden of life and 
entered into that peaceful sleep which ends at the final resurrection. Of 
their six children the following survive: ^lary, Mrs. I. S. Alderman; John, 
who resides in New York; and Tennie. ]\Irs. Simon I-J. Wilson, of Philadel-

S. STAXGER ISZARD. 



Among the practitioners of the New Jersey bar whose ability entitles 
them to a position of distinction in the profession is S. Stanger Iszard. who 
resides in Woodbury, but practices there and in Camden. He is one of the 
leading real-estate and corporation lawyers of this section of the state, and 
as advancement at the bar depends solely upon individual merit his position 
stands in evidence of his comprehensive knowledge of the principles of juris- 
prudence and his accuracy in applying them to the points in litigation. 

Mr. Iszard was born in Swedesboro, January 7, i860, began his educa- 
tion in the common schools and took a college preparatory course in Pen- 
nington Seminar}-. In 1884 he matriculated in Princeton College, and on 
the completion of a thorough four-years' course, was graduated with honors 
in the class of 1887 and received the degree of M. A. in 1890. \\'ith a broad 
general information and classical knowledge to serve as a foundation on 
which to rear the superstructure of professional learning, he entered upon 
the study of law and was graduated in the law department of the University 
of Pennsylvania in the class of 1889, with the degree of LL. B. He studied 
in the ofifice of C. Stuart Patterson Esq.. then dean of the law department 
of the university. He was admitted to the bar of the Keystone state in that 
year and licensed to practice in the supreme court of Pennsylvania in 1892. 
He was admitted to the bar of New Jersey in 1891, but had entered upon 
his professional career in Pennsylvania in 1889. He took up his residence 
in Woodbury, in November. 1894, and in 1896 opened an oiifice in Cam- 
den, where he has secured a large clientage. He is well versed in the law 
in all its various branches, but makes a specialty of corporation and real 
estate law, and is legal counsel for the Glassboro Bank, the ^^'est Jersey 
Real Estate Company and other corporations. He has conducted several 
important bank cases and real-estate suits, and has won some notable tri- 
umphs in the courts, where his sound arguments and logical deductions 
always carry weight and seldom fail to convince. 

In June. 1892, Mr. Iszard was united in marriage to Miss Mary E.. 
daughter of William S. Zane. a representative of a very old family of New 
Jersey. They have one child, Miriam. In his social relations Mr. Iszard 
is a Mason and is past master of Glassboro Lodge, No. 85, F. & A. M. He 
was at one time quite actively interested in Sunday-school work. In po'i-

tics he is a zealous Republican and keeps well informed on the issues and 
questions of the day, both political and otherwise. A public-spirited citizen, 
he manifests a commendable interest in everything pertaining to the general 
welfare and withholds his support from no movement for the public good. 



WILLIAM J. HELMS. 



William J. Helms is numbered among the merchants of Bridgeport, New 
Jersey, where he is conducting a well-appointed establishment, stocked with 
a large line of general mercantile goods. He was born on a farm in Logan 
township, Gloucester county, near Repaupo, November 6, 185 1, and is a 
son of James Ellet and Hannah (Justice) Helms, of Repaupo. 

The family is of Swedish lineage and was founded in America by Hans 
Helms, who came from Sweden to the New World prior to the Revolution- 
ary war and was the owner of a rich tract of land in New Jersey. James Ellet 
Helms is one of the most prosperous and influential farmers of Gloucester 
county. He was born in this locality August i, 1818, and has resided at his 
present place of residence since 1853. Through continuous industry and 
economy he has accumulated a handsome fortune and now owns several fine 
farms. His life demonstrates the possibilities which lie before those of de- 
termined purpose, keen discrimination and untiring enterprise, for it is these 
qualities which have brought to him marked prosperity in the business atYairs 
of life. He is a stanch silver Democrat and has had a life-long aversion to 
banks, with which he refuses to transact any business, even to the extent of 
making deposits in such institutions. 

On the 13th of March, 1845, he was married to Miss Hannah Justice, a 
daughter of William and Mary (Perkins) Justice. Five children were born to 
Mr. and Mrs. Helms: Elizabeth, the wife of Henry Shoemaker, who follows 
farming near Repaupo; Hance, who also carries on agricultural pursuits in 
that locality; William Justice; Emma; and John, who occupies one of his 
father's farms. The parents are members of the Methodist Episcopal church, 
and all who know them respect them for their manv excellencies of charac- 
ter. 

William J. Helms pursued his preliminary education in the public schools 
of Logan township and subsequently matriculated in Wyoming Seminary 
at Kingston, Pennsylvania. \Vhile under the parental roof he was taught the 
various branches of farm work and on putting aside his text-books he re- 
turned home to assist his father in the labors of the farm, his energies being 
thus occupied for nine years. In 1886 he came to Bridgeport, where he has

since engaged in general merchandising, liis commercial efforts being attended 
with excellent success. He carries a large line of goods, such as is demanded 
bv a general trade: and his reasonable prices, thorough reliability, and earnest 
desire to please have gained to him a very liberal patronage. 

On the Jjth of November, 1877, Mr. Helms was united in marriage to 
Miss Emily \\'. Gill, a daughter of Stineman Gill, of Logan township. They 
are both members of the Methodist Episcopal church of Bridgeport, take 
an active part in its work and are very active in advancing its interests along 
the various lines of Christian activity and effort. Mr. Helms was formerly 
the Sunday-school superintendent and is now serving as a steward of the 
church. In politics he gives his support to the Prohibition party, for he is 
in deep sympathy with the temperance movement. Socially he is connected 
with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the .American Order of 
United W^orkmen and enjoys the high regard of his brethren in those frater- 
nities. 



MATTHI.AS M. CHE^^^ 

Matthias M. Chew, of Cecil, Gloucester county. New Jersey, is one of 
the most highly esteemed citizens of this part of the state and has gained 
more than a local reputation as a successful grower of cranberries. He has 
won his success by patient industry and the application of sound common 
sense to his business interests. He was 1)orn Feljruary 22, 1842, at Marsh 
Lake, near Malaga, this county, and is a son of Thomas E. and Elizabeth 
(Miller) Chew. His grandfather. Robert Chew, was of English birth and was 
one of four brothers who came from that country and located in America, 
one in Philadelphia, one in Maryland and two in this state. 

Thomas E. Chew was l)orn at Marsh Lake and resided there until he had 
attained his majority, when he moved to Clayton and there in 1850 he made 
the first brick manufactured in that town. In 1870 he moved to Cecil, where 
he owned two hundred and fifty acres of land, fifteen of which he planted to 
cranberries, as it was admirably adapted to the raising of that fruit. He was 
a man of exemplary character, incapable of a mean action, and possessed of 
a remarkably bright intellect. His death was the result of an accident in the 
mill, from which he died in April, 1872. His wife, who survives him and is in 
her seventy-sixth year, was in her maidenhood Miss Elizabeth Miller. Eleven 
children were born to them, six of whom are still living, namely: William H., 
of Hurfifville: Matthias M., our subject: Susannah H.. widow of Mascal Bates: 
Robert C, who operates a sawmill near Cecil: Sallie M., of Girard College, 
Philadelphia: and Thomas \\'.. who resides near Cecil.

Matthias JM. Chew attended the pubUc schools in liis l^oyhood Init added 
greatly to his knowledge by a private course of study at night. In this man- 
ner he mastered the intricacies of the legal profession and also familiarized 
himself with surveying and conveyancing. Before he was twenty-one he en- 
listed at Glassboro in the Twenty-fourth New Jersey Regiment and was in the 
battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. The spring following the 
death of his father. 1873, he purchased the home farm and has since added 
to that property until now he has one thousand acres of land. He has one 
hundred acres in cranlierries. He has given to the subject of cranberry cul- 
ture the closest attention and study and has had his care rewarded by bounti- 
ful crops of the finest berries. He markets five thousand crates of berries an- 
nually and no man knows l:)etter than he the dangers and difficulties which 
menace the growing crop. The gathering in of the crop has always been a 
source of trouble and annoyance to the grower, and to do away with this 
difficulty he has placed on the market a cranberry picker, an invention of his 
own fertile brain, which meets the requirement fully and will do the work of 
six or eight ordinary pickers. He has a fine farm and everywhere does it 
show the evidence of his care and ingenuity. He had some wild chestnut 
trees on his farm and as they were too beautiful to be destroyed he decided 
to try to make them profitable and grafted them with the Japan chestnut. 
The experiment proved successful, and he now has some of the finest chest- 
nuts to be obtained. 

:Mr. Chew was married in 1864 to a lady of the same name and a distant 
connection. She was Miss Mary Etta, a daughter of Thomas A. Chew. 
Of the seven children born to them. four attained maturity: 
Abbie. who first married Horace Wise, of Williamstown, and afterward Frank 
Clark, of Piny Hollow and is now deceased; Edward D., who resides at 
Cecil: Samuel, a resident of Williamstown; and Lizzie M., who married 
Charles T. Allen, of Pleasantville. this state. 

Mr. Chew is independent in his political affiliations but has been very 
active in local political work. He was a director in the board of freeholders 
when the present court-house was built — from 1883 to 1888 — and was chair- 
man of the Ijoard for four years. He was a candidate for the nomination for 
state senator in the Republican party at one time under the Crawford system, 
but did not receive the nomination, although he received a very flattering 
vote. He has been a commissioner of deeds for twenty years: justice of the 
peace fifteen years and notary public for the past six years. He has often 
been a delegate to state, congressional and other conventions and has ever 
been a forceful advocate of the principles he held. He is the postmaster of 
Cecil post-office, which was established through his suggestion and influence.

DA\'ID F. HAINES. 



It is always a pleasure to see true merit suitably rewarded, to behold the 
prosperity of those who eminently deserve it, as does the subject of this re- 
view. At an early age he learned one of the great lessons of life, that there 
is no "royal" road to fortune, and. as he was not abo\e work, he toiled indus- 
triously until he won, not only a comfortable fortune but also the esteem 
and confidence of the people with whom he has been associated for many 
years. Work, the true friend of mankind, has developed his latent resources 
and brought out the strong, self-reliant force of his character. 

His father, Aaron W. Haines, possessed the same enterprising, ambitious 
spirit, and the place which he occupied in his communitv — Yorktown and 
vicinity — cannot easily be filled. His useful, active life came to a close on 
the 13th of January, 1897, '" ^'^^ sixty-ninth year of his age. his birth having 
occurred November 2, 1831. He was a son of John Haines, Jr., who was 
born April 9, 1791, and died August 2, 1863. His wife died May 6, 1876. 
He was a son of John and Margaret Haines: the fomier, born May 12. 1742. 
was a son of John and Rebecca Haines, ^^'hen Aaron Haines was a young 
man. he learned the trade of wheelwright, which calling he followed, at 
intervals, from 1850 until 1858, and in 1857 or 1858 he became financially 
interested in a brick and tile factor)-, located on property adjoining his own 
farm, the one now in possession of our subject. This plant had been organ- 
ized by several Englishmen, and for a few years it was not a successful 
\enture. In 1866 ;Mr. Haines became its sole proprietor, and by his excel-

lent management and enterprise he soon had the affairs on a firm busmess 
basis, and a sure foundation laid for future success. Until two years prior 
to his death, he continued in charge of the factory, then turning it over to 
his son, David F. A man of true worth. Aaron Haines sought to promote 
the welfare of his neighbors, and to do all within his power to advance 
education and progress along all lines. He served as a school trustee and 
overseer of roads, besides holding other local otifices of more or less respon- 
sibility, and never failed to acquit himself creditably. His six brothers and 
sisters all survive him. Joseph H.. the youngest, of Cape May county, Xew 
Jersey, has represented his district in the state senate, and the others are 
named respectively Mary Ann, Margaret, Elizabeth. Esther and Edward C. 
Aaron and Charlotte R. Haines (his wife) were natives of Salem county, 
the former born in Piles Grove (Woodstown) and the latter in Mannington 
township. She was born August 12, 1834, and died September 29, 1884, 
at the age of fifty years. She was one of the eight children of David F. and 
Ann fTreillender) Stanger, who were likewise ijorn and reared in this county. 
The father followed farming and shoemaking, served as a constable for a 
time and was a man of influence in his locality. He was born September 16, 
1792, and attained the advanced age of ninety years, his death occurring 
August 5, 1882. His wife, Mrs. Ann Stanger. was born March 31, 1802, and 
died January 20, 1866. Concerning their eight children we make the fol- 
lowing observations: Harriet became the wife of George Biddle and died 
on the 6th of November, 1889; Catherine, also deceased, became the wife 
of William Patterson and after his death wedded David Sparks ; she was the 
mother of Editor Patterson, of Woodstown; Serena is the wife of William 
Boltinghouse; William B. wedded Jane Dubois and is now deceased; Re- 
becca is the wife of James Wills; Annie is the wife of Paul Wills, a brother of 
her sister's husband; David P. wedded Adelaide Elwell; and Charlotte is the 
wife of Aaron Haines. The union of Aaron Haines and wife was blessed 
with eight children, namely: David F., William P., born May 24, 1856. and 
died March 18, 1862; Omar B., born February 4, i860, and died Decemljer 
8, 1861; Addie E., born September 17, 1862; Mary W., born August 20, 
1865; Harriet ^vl., born October 26, 1869; Kate E., born January 14. 1872; 
and Sadie T., born January 30, 1876. Two sons are deceased. Addie is the 
wife of Daniel Fries. Mary is Mrs Amos T^aunt. Harriet is Mrs. Elwood 
Matlack; and Sadie married Dallas Emmel of Alloway. 

David F. Haines was born in Woodstown, Salem county, Qctol^er 31, 
1852. When he was only fourteen years old he commenced working aljout 
the brick kilns and obtained a practical knowledge of the business. In 1870 
he was admitted to partnership with his father, the firm name becoming Aaron 



48o BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

W. Haines & Son. This i:)nsiness connection continued in force until tlie death 
of his father, when our suljject liecame the sole proprietor of the factory and 
plant, located in the western part of Alloway township. The kilns are near 
a bed of very tine clay, practically inexhaustible, and especially adapted for 
the manufacture of strong, durable tile and brick. The plant, which is one 
of the best in the country, is fitted with modern machinery and appliances 
and its output of brick has been utilized in the construction of numerous 
substantial buildings in Salem, Woodstown, Hancock's Bridge and elsewhere. 
It is the only drain-tile factory in south Jersey, and a ready sale is found 
for this article in Trenton, Easton and adjoining states, as well as in this 
immediate vicinity. The factory has a capacity of from six to eight hundred 
thousand brick and two hundred thousand tile, while the sawmill has turned 
out nearly one hundred and fifty thousand feet of lumber the past year. 
]\Ir. Haines has been associated with the management of this enterprise for 
about a third of a century and few men in the business are better acquainted 
with the demands of the trade. By the exercise of industry and system, he 
is steadily increasing his patronage and record as a business man, and the 
outlook is very promising. 

In 1883 Mr. Haines wedded Sallie Richman, by whom he has two chil- 
dren, Lottie and Mabel, the former born November 26, 1883, the latter born 
March 7, 1887. Mrs. Haines is a daughter of John C. and Sarah A. (Agins) 
Richman, the former of Woodstown and the latter of Mullica Hill, Glouces- 
ter county. The father died in i860, at the age of fifty years, and his widow, 
who died in Woodstown in 1889, was in her eightieth year. Their children 
are Hannah, the wife of Moses Richman; Martha, the wife of Isaac Coles: 
Isabella, now Mrs. Josiah Holmes; Margaret, Mrs. Samuel Goslin, now 
deceased; Emily, the wife of Charles Sickler. Sally and John O. 



FRANK LEAMING. 



Frank Leaming, a son of Richard S. and Amelia (Ludham) Leaming. 
was born at South Dennis, Cape May county, March 10, 1857. He pursued 
his early education in the public schools of his native town, and later took 
the English course in the South Jersey Institute. After putting aside his 
text books he started out in life for himself, and spent five years in the south, 
visiting many places in Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee. On the 
expiration of that period he returned to Cape May county, but after three 
years he went to the west, spending the following decade in Missouri anrl 
Arizona. Since that time he has resided continuously in Cape l\Iay county.

482 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Fifield, whose birth also occurred at tliat place, and who was a farmer In- 
occupation. Jonathan Fifield remained in his native town until his removal 
to Cape ]\Iay Court House, where he spent his remaining days. He was a 
mason and contractor, and was prominently identified with the building in- 
terests of his adopted city. He exercised his right of franchise in support of 
the men and measures of the Republican party. His wife bore the maiden 
name of Alary Hand, and was a daughter of Recompense Hand. Unto Mr.

in childhood: Rebecca, the wife of Charles G. Mills, a painter of Cape May 
Court House, by whom she has one son, Edward C: and Mary A., the 
mother of our subject. Dr. Joseph Fifield, an uncle of our subject, removed 
from Stratham, New Hampshire, to Cape May Court House about 1820. 
He was a surgeon in the First Battalion, in the War of 1812. He jjecame a 
merchant of Camden, Xew Jersey, acquired considerable wealth, and died 
in that city. 

Unto Air. and Airs. Alexander Springer were born the following chil- 
dren : Joseph shipped before the mast when only thirteen years of age. and 
throughout his life has been connected with the sea. He has made a num- 
ber of voyages around the world, and is now in the life-saving station at 
Cold Springs, his residence being at Cape Alay. He married Ann Eldredge, 
and they have four daughters, — Alary, Alice, Elsie and Amelia. Charles 
AI. went to sea and no news has been received from him since he was seven- 
teen years of age, so that it is supposed he was lost. Ella is the wife of

Percy Holderman, and their children are Alexander W.. Percv and Anna B. 
The father of this family died December 14. 1896. at the age of sixtv-two 
years. 

During his early boyhood Edward W. Springer accompanied his pa- 
rents to Cape Alay Point, and acquired his education in its public schools. 
After leaving the school-room he learned the carpenter's trade with his 
father, became an expert workman and finally engaged in contracting on his 
own account, erecting a number of the best buildings in the town, which 
to-day stand as monuments to his skill and enterprise. He is now engaged 
in the grocery business and has one of the best appointed stores in the place. 
Through his honorable dealing and earnest desire to please he has se- 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEir JERSEY. 483 

cured a liberal patronage and deri\es therefrom a good income, his sales 
amounting to fifteen thousand dollars a year. 

Mr. Springer is a man of resourceful business ability and has not con- 
fined his efforts to one line. He is to-day one of the leading real-estate 
dealers of the place, owning nine-tenths of the real estate here, to the value 
of about one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. He put up all the 
hotels, and in other ways contributed to the growth and upbuilding of the 
Point. He is the secretary of the Cape May branch of the New Jersey 
Building & Loan Association, is the superintendent and lessee of the Cape 
May Point water-works, and is the superintendent of the Isaac John estate. 
He is also serving as postmaster under President McKinley's administra- 
tion and in politics is a stalwart Republican, unswerving in his support of 
the principles of the party. 

In 1894 Mr. Springer was united in marriage to Miss Fannie, daughter 
of George Dickinson, a sea captain. They occupy one of the beautiful resi- ' 
deuces at Cape May Point, and enjoy the hospitality of the best homes in 
this section of the state. Socially Mr. Springer is connected with the Order 
of Heptasophs. His business interests have been attended with splendid 
success, and his judicious investments, capable management and persever- 
ance in the pursuit of a persistent purpose have made him one of the wealthy 
men of the county. He is quick of apprehension and intricate business af- 
fairs he comprehends in a moment. Such are the elements which have con- 
tributed to his success and made him one of the leading factors in the com- 
mercial activity of southern New jersev. 



CHARLES CUNNINGHAM. 

One of the younger members of the medical fraternity in Atlantic county 
is Charles Cunningham, a physician of Hammonton. Many an older practi- 
tioner might well envy the success he has attained, for he now occupies a 
place of distinction among the followers of this humane profession. He 
is one of the native sons of New Jersey, his birth having occurred in ^'ine- 
land in December, 1868, and his parents being David and EHzabeth (Tread- 
way) Cunningham. His father was a shoemaker, but is now living a retired 
life in \'ineland, at the age of seventy-five years. The mother has been 
called to the home beyond. 

Dr. Cunningham was reared in his native village and obtained his edu- 
cation in the public and high schools there. He studied medicine under the 
direction of Dr. \V. F. Sawyer, of \'ine]and. and in order to pursue a col-

let^iate course worked at the cari)enter"s trade and at shoemaking. Tlius 
he obtained the capital necessary to meet his expenses and in 1891 he en- 
tered the Jefferson Medical College, of Philadelphia, where he was graduated 
in the class of 1894. He then spent six months in Cape May county, after 
wiiich he came to Hammonton, where he has since enjoyed an extensive 
practice. From the beginning he has received the patronage of some of 
the best people of the place and his skill and ability have won their con- 
fidence and support. He is now serving as one of tlie coroners of the county 
and is a member of the board of health and a board of health inspector. 
His political support is given to the Republican party. 

In 1895 Dr. Cunningham was united in marriage to ]Miss Mabel Parker, 
a graduated nurse of Hahnemann Hospital, in Philadelphia, and a daughter 
of J. N. Parker, formerly an iron founder of Vineland. They now have two 
children, Lola and Annie. The Doctor devotes his time and energies ex- 
clusi\ely to the duties of his profession and has gained high rank among 
his brethren of the medical fraternity. He is an earnest and thorough 
student and at all times keeps abreast with the progress which characterizes 
the profession. 



T.AMES B. POTTER. 



On the roll of those who de\ote their energies to the practice of law is 
found the name of James Boyd Potter, wlio is one of the younger represent- 
atives of the bar. yet has already attained distinction in connection with 
his chosen calling. His paternal grandfather, James Boyd Potter, Sr., was 
born in Bridgeton, January 7, 1796. and obtained his education in the 
public schools of his native town. For many years he was an active factor 
in commercial circles, conducting a general mercantile establishment, and in 
this field of endeavor he secured a very liberal patronage, winning thereby 
a handsome competence. He «lso became the president of a bank. 

William E. Potter, the father of our subject, w-as born January 13, 1840. 
in Bridgeton. New Jersey, and pursued his education in the West Jersey 
Academy and in Princeton College, where he was graduated with the class 
of 1863. He was endowed by nature with strong mentality, and his prefer- 
ence was for professional life. Accordingly he entered the Harvard Law- 
School, and was graduated in that institution in 1861, after which he estab- 
lished himself in the law practice in Bridgeton. being a prominent member of 
the bar until November 9, 1896. He won marked distinction by the able 
manner in which he handled the litigated interests entrusted to his care. He 




^uo.

COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF XEJV JERSEY. 485 

was very thorough and accurate in the preparation of his cases, and fortified 
his position with logic almost incontrovertible. His arguments were always 
forceful and seldom failed to gain the point desired, being based upon a com- 
prehensive knowledge of judicial principles as applied to the facts in con- 
troversy. His reputation has extended far beyond the confines of the town 
in which he has made his home; in fact, he was known as one of the dis- 
tinguished representatives of the legal profession in the state. He served as 
the citv solicitor of Bridgeton. and was the county solicitor for two or three 
terms. He was also the president of the .\tlantic and Cape May County Bar 
Association, and of the State Bar Association, having served as 
one of the first vice-presidents of the latter. He acted as the 
leading counsel in the defence of Charles K. Landis. tried for the 
murder of Charles Carruth. and secured his acquittal. He served as 
a United States attorney in 1875. and tried many important civil as well as 
criminal suits; in fact, was well versed in all of the departments in juris- 
prudence. As a corporation lawyer he was particularly distinguished, and 
acted as the solicitor for most of the important Inisiness concerns of Bridge- 
ton. He was the counsel for the Millville ^Manufacturing Company and for 
W'hitall, Tatuni & Company, the proprietors of the largest glass factory in 
this section of the state. In politics he was a stalwart Republican, and 
served as presidential elector when General Grant was elected for his second 
term. He was also a presidential elector in 1880. when he cast his ballot 
for Garfield. He was a delegate to many state and national conventions, and 
his opinions always carried weight in the councils of the party. During the 
civil war he manifested his loyalty to the Union cause by enlisting in the 
Twelfth New Jersey Infantry, becoming a member of Company K, in Jnne, 
1862. The command was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, and he par- 
ticipated in all the engagements with his division until the close of the war. 
He enlisted as a private, but his meritorious conduct on the field of battle 
won him promotion to the rank of major, and he served as a judge advocate 
on the staft' of General Gibbons and on the staff of General Hayes and for 
the Fourth Armv Corps. He was wounded in the ankle by a minie ball 
in the battle of the ^^'ilderness, and was confined in the hospital for two 
months. His lovaltv was above question and his patriotism throughout his 
entire life was one of his marked characteristics. After the war lie was 
known among his friends as Colonel Potter, and held that rank while serving 
on the staff of Governor Ward. Pleasant relationship with his army com- 
rades was maintained through his connection with the Pennsylvania Com- 
manderv of the Loyal Legion, the society of the Army of the Potomac, the 
New Jersev Society of Cincinnati and (jeneral Meade Post, G. A. R., of

Philadelphia. He was also a \'alue(l re]3resentati\e of the [Masonic order, he- 
longing to Brearley Lodge. Xo. 2. of Bridgeton. 

On the 27th of May. 1869, William Potter was united in marriage to }iliss 
Alice Eddy, and to them were born five children, four sons and one daughter: 
Alfred Eddy, born March 15, 1870. was educated in the West Jersey Acad- 
emy; James Boyd is the next younger: David, born December 19, 1874. 
pursued his education in the West Jersey Academy and was graduated in 
Princeton College with the class of 1896. He studied law with his brother 
James, was admitted to the bar in June, 1897, and practiced for a short time. 
but abandoned the profession to become an assistant paymaster in the United 
States Xa\ y. He served on the Katahdin during the Spanish-American war. 
and is now stationed in the Philippines. Alice was born February 13. 1877. 
and was educated at Seven Gables and in I\y Hill Seminary: and Francis 
Delavan. born Mav 24. 1880. was educated in the \\ est Jersev Academv and 
in Princeton College, and is the youngest of the family. The father died 
November 9, 1896. at the age of fifty-six years. He was one who carved his 
name deeply on the history of this state, his life record being inseparably inter- 
woven with the military and judicial annals of New Jersey. He was a man 
of marked individuality, of strong mentality and of great force of character, 
and his position of leadership was accorded him by reason of his superior ex- 
ecutive ability. He commanded uniform confidence and won the close friend- 
ship of all with whom he was intimately associated. 

James Boyd Potter, whose name introduces this record, was born at 
Bridgeton on the 22d of January. 1873. and pursued liis education in the 
West Jersey Academw in w hich he w as graduated with the class of 1889. He 
afterward entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, was 
graduated in 1893. and was honorably discharged from the service in 1895. 
The very thorough course and excellent mental as well as manual and mili- 
tary training in that institution well fitted him to begin his professional 
studies, and on leaving the service he took up the study of law under the 
direction of his father, being admitted to the bar as an attorney in November. 
1896. and as counselor in 1899. In the latter year he was elected the city 
solicitor of Bridgeton. During the Spanish-American war he held the lieu- 
tenancy in the navy and was stationed on the United States steamship Mon- 
tauk. He is now the commander of the battalion of West in the New Jersey 
Naval Reserves, and is a member of the Pennsylvania Commandery, Naval 
Order of the United States, also of the New York Commandery of the Na\al 
and Military Order of the Spanish-American w ar. 

With the surrender of the Spanish fleet and the withdraw al of the Span- 
ish soldiers from the territor\- ceded to the United States, the need for troo]«

was in consequence lessened, and Lieutenant Potter received an honora1ile 
discharge. He then resumed his professional labors and is to-day one of the 
leading young- members of the bar of southern New Jersey. Professional 
advancement depends entirely upon individual merit. The reputation of 
one's forefathers availeth naught in such a case, and that Mr. Potter has 
won success is due to his strong mental force, his close application and his 
devotion to the interests of his clients. Guided by strong determination and 
a laudable ambition, he will undoubtedly win greater honors and successes in 
the future. He is now a director in the West Jersey Mail & Transportation 
Company. His political support is given the Republican party and he is a 
member of th€ Presbyterian church. In social circles he is popular, com- 
manding the esteem and friendh- regard of those with whom he comes in 
contact. 



JOEL G. LAXGLEY. 

Joel G. Langley, of \\'illow Grove. Salem county. New Jersey, was born 
on the farm upon which he now resides in Lower Pittsgrove township, on 
Alarch 20. 1849. He is a son of Richard and Keturah (Garrison) Langley 
and a grandson of John Langley, one of the first settlers of this neighbor- 
hood who came from Langle\'s Hollow, England, and settled near Millville. 
Richard Langley followed the occupation of farmer and miller, owning a 
mill at Millville and at one time one thousand acres of land. He operated 
a mill at Willow Grove for several years, after being similarly employed for 
ten years at Millville. He was a local minister in the Methodist Episcopal 
church, and although he had but a limited education he was a forceful and 
convincing speaker through wdiose instrumentality great good was accom- 
plished. He was a friend of everybody and ever}body was his friend, and 
his death, which occurred on this farm in 1887, was widely and deeplv 
mourned. He was a very capable man of business and gave abundantly of 
his means to religious and charitable work. He was joined in marriage with

Joel (i. Lanoiey attended pul)lic school in his boyhood and spent his 
spare time in tlie mill and about farm work. He became thoroughly familiar 
w ith e\er\' department of both lines of work, and after completing his school- 
ing took lip the occupation of farmer, which he has since followed in a pro- 
gressive and up-to-date maimer. He has been very successful in his iiusi- 
ness and owns one hundred and fifty acres of fine land, eighty of which he 
has under a high state of cultivation, and is tilled under his personal super- 
vision. He is regarded as one of the leading men of Salem county and is 
c|uick to advocate and push to completion any project that tends to Imild 
up the comnumity. It was through his influence that the old, destructible 
bridges were dis]ilaced by the neat, durable structures of stone, of which the 
comity is justly proud. He is a Democrat in politics and takes an active 
interest in the success of his party, keeping well posted on all current topics 
and giving excellent reasons for his views. He is a member of the Methodist 
Episcopal church at Willow (iro\e. in which he has served as trustee and 
steward, is a class-leader in their meetings and the al)le and efficient super- 
intendent of their Sunday-school.

Jacob Creamer, of Union Grove, who has been to him a faithful and loving 
wife, sharing his trials and joys and encouraging him by word and example 
when his path was beset by difficulties. Five children were born to them, 
namely: Albert F., who married Miss Lethea. a daughter of Jacob Hitch-

BENJAMIN M. FERGUSON. 

Benjamin M. Ferguson, a retired business man of Alloway, Salem coinUy, 
New Jersey, is among the venerated residents of the county and has worked 
with untiring zeal for the success that has crowned his eft'orts. He was 
liorn in this village September 6. 1828. to William and Mary (MauH Fer- 
guson, and has seen great advancement here during his seventy-odd years 
of life. His grandfather, Joseph F., was a farmer of Upper .\lloway town- 
ship and reared several children, of whom A\"illiam, the father of our sub- 
ject, was the youngest and only son. William Ferguson resided at .MIo- 
way Creek and carried on extensive farming operations until his death, at

the age of seventy-eight years. He was a Democrat and a member of the 
Alloway Baptist church. He \\as twice married, his first wife being the 
mother of five children, viz.: Joseph, deceased, a farmer; Benjamin M.; 
Smith, a farmer; William and Mary Ann. The mother died in her fifty-fifth 
year and the father at the more advanced age of seventy-eight. 

Benjamin M. Ferguson. remained on the farm with his father until he 
was grown and then became coimected with the firm of Reeves & Brothers, 
ship-builders, working for them as long as they continued in business. His 
next \enture was in the butcher business, which was commenced in a very 
moderate, unpretentious w'ay, his first delivery of meats being made in a 
wheelbarrow. He butchered his own meat and was careful in its selection 
so that his customers might have only the choicest article. His novel man- 
ner of delivering his goods was continued until a horse and wagon were 
purchased and the wheelbarrow displaced for the more convenient and 
modern conveyance. He continued in this business for a period of twenty 
years and met with a remarkable degree of success. He then ran a stage 
between Greenwich and Philadelphia and Chesterton and Elkton, a dis- 
tance of fifty-two miles, and took the contract to carry the mail for four 
years. His next venture was as the landlord of the Haverford Hotel, at 
Cape May Court House, which he conducted for five years, when he came 
to Alloway and for eight years was the popular and obliging landlord of 
the hotel in this village. This house when he purchased it was known as 
the American House but is now called the Horsemen's Inn. As a hotel- 
keeper he was a decided "success" and was in very great favor with his 
guests and the traveling public. There is nothing so conducive to man's 
comfort and happiness as well cooked and neatly served food, a fact which 
was well understood by Mr. Ferguson; and the feasibility of establishing a 
house where everything is clean, neat and inviting and presided over by 
pleasant, affable attendants, was proved by the American House receiving 
the "cream" of the trade. His menu was all that could be desired and most 
inviting to a hungry person, and the reputation of his hotel soon spread 
among the traveling men as a resort where they would receive courteous 
treatment and the best service. In 1896 he disposed of this property and 
retired from active life, taking possession of his handsome residence in this 
\illage. He has extensive timber lands in this county, owning some five 
hundred acres in Alloway township besides a small farm which is under 
cultivation. 

Mr. Ferguson was married in 1852 to Miss Hannah Donnell, by whom 
he had one child, Ida W. His second marriage was contracted in 1872, with 
Mrs. Hilary A. Garrison, who died in 1887. He has been a lifelong Demo-

public-spirited citizens who do a town good and his influence and enter- 
prise have been of inestimable value to Allowa}'. 



Y. M. D. MARCY, 11. D. 



In studying the lives and characters of prominent men we are naturally 
letl to inquire into the secret of their success and the motives that ])romptecl 
their action. Success is oftener a matter of exjjerience and sound judgment 
and thorough preparation for a life work than it is of genius, however bright. 
When we trace the career of those whom the world acknowledges as suc- 
cessful and of those who stand highest in public esteem, we find that in almost 
every case they are those who have risen gradually by their own efforts, 
their diligence and perseverance. These qualities are undoubtedly possessed 
in a large measure by the gentleman whose name introduces this sketch, and 
added to these is a devotion to principle that may well be termed the key- 
note of his character. It is this which commands the confidence and respect 
so uniformly, given him, and it is this that has secured him his liberal pat- 
ronage as a memlier of the medical fraternit\' of southern New Jersey. 

Dr. \'irgil Maro Dow ^larcy is now a well known practitioner of Cape 
May. and is numbered among the native sons of Cape May county, his birth 
having occurred at Cold Spring, January 5, 1823. He is a representative of 
one of the oldest American families and traces his ancestry back to John 
Marcy, of whom the first written notice appears in Elliot's Church Record 
in Roxbury, Massachusetts, as follows: "John Marcy took the Covenant, 
March 7, 1685." Among his descendants many have gained positions of 
distinction, including William Larned Marcy, once secretary of state, and 
governor of New Jersey; General Randolph B. Marcy and Dr. Erastus E. 
Marcy. John Marcy, the original American ancestor, was the son of the high 
sheriff of Limerick, Ireland. He was born about the year 1662, and in April, 
1686. joined a colony that took possession of Quatosett, now Woodstock, 
Connecticut. He married Sarah Hadlock, a daughter of James and Sarah 
(Draper) Hadlock, of Roxbury, Massachusetts. She was born December 
16, 1670, and they spent the greater part of their li\-es in ^Yoodstock, where 
John Marcy died December 23, 1724, at the age of sixty-two; his wife May 
9. 1743, at the age of se\ent\'-three. They were the parents of eleven 
children.

James Marcv. their thirrl cliil.l, was l.orn in Woodstock. Connecticut. 
February 26, 1691. and married Judith Ainsworth. who was born January 
25, 1722, a daughter of Edward and Joanna ( Hemmingway) Ainsworth. His 
death occurred January 29, 1763. 

Of his eight children, Reuben, the third, was the great-grandfather of 
our subject. He was born in 1732 and married Rachel Watson, of Barring- 
ton, Rhode Island. As a life work he followed farming in Ashford, Connec- 
ticut. He had four children, the third being Reuben, Jr., who was born in 
1768 and married Hannah Sumner, of Roxbury, Massachusetts. She was 
born in 1770. and died in Berlin. Connecticut, in 1843. His life was spent 
as a farmer in W'illington. Connecticut, where his death occurred in 1824. 
They had four sons and four daughters. The sons were: Edward, who 
died in Will countv, Illinois: Samuel Sumner; Matthew, who served as the 
judge of Cape May countv: and William W., who was liorn in November. 
i8ov and married Martha Knowlton. 

Samuel Sumner Marcy. the father of the Doctor, was born in Willington, 
Ashford countv, Connecticut, al)out 1798 or 99, obtained his literary edu- 
cation in the public schools of his native state, and then prepared for the 
practice of medicine in the office and under the direction of Dr. Palmer, of 
Ashford, and in Yale College, being graduated in the medical department of 
that institution about 1S20. Throughout his business career he engaged 
m the practice of his chosen profession and won distinction as one of its most 
alile representatives in southern New Jersey. From 1820 until 1830 he 
served as a surgeon in the New Jersey militia. He took up his aliode in 
Dennisville, New Jersey, soon after his graduation, afterward removed to 
Cold Spring, Cape May county, and in 1849 went to Cape May City, where 
he continued in practice until his death. He held a number of local offices, 
discharging his duties with marked promptness and fidelity, and his political 
support was given the Democracy. He was a valued member of the County 
Medical Society and the State J^Iedical Society, and always kept abreast with 
the profession in its advancement in various lines of medical research. He 
died at the advanced age of eighty-nine years, and his wife passed away at 
the age of sixty. 

This worthv couple were the parents of eight children. Virgil M. D. is 
the eldest. Harriet Matilda married John K. F. Stites, who in early life fol- 
lowed farming but later became a Sunday-school missionary and traveled 
throughout New Jersey, organizing Sunday-schools in behalf of the Presby- 
terian church. He has made his home in Cape May and Camden, and by his 
marriage he had four children — Samuel, w^ho died in childhood, John, Win- 
held Scott and Alva Freeman. IMartha :\laria Coburn became the second

wife of Rev. Augustus Theodore Dol^son, a Presliyterian minister, of Long- 
Island, New York, who afterward removed to Cliester, Pennsylvania. They 
had three children — Augustus T., Jr.. and Samuel and Elizabeth, who died 
in childhood. Sarah ]\IcKean, the fourth of the family, died in childhood. 
Hannah Elizabeth was the first wife of Rev. Augustus T. Dobson and had 
two children — William A., who was in the employ of the government for a 
time and is now a ilraftsman in the Cramps shipyard, of Philadelphia: and 
Mattie. the wife of James Hargan. Alexander, the sixth child, died in early 
boyhood. Alexander (2d), a physician, married Hannah Ann McCray. and 
thev have two children — John W., a member of the medical fraternity, and 
Mary A. Thriphena Edmunds is the widow of James Gass. who was a 
merchant, and thev had two sons and two daughters, Robert, Samuel S.. 
Harriet M. and ^lary Jane. 

Dr. Marcy, whose name introduces this record, was educated in private 
schools, in Cold Spring and in Berlin, Connecticut, thus gaining a good pre- 
liminary education. In 1840. when seventeen years of age, he matriculated 
in Yale College and was graduated with the class of 1844. He was a mem- 
ber of the Phi Beta Kappa, an honorary society to which only al)Out one- 
third of the class was eligible. He received the degree of Bachelor of Arts 
upon his graduation, and two years later the degree of Master of Arts was 
conferred upon him. He prepared for tlie medical profession within the 
classic walls of his alma mater and in the University of Maryland, at Balti- 
more, and after his graduation in the latter institution, in 1846. he located 
in Gloucester county, Virginia, where he engaged in practice for three years. 
On the expiration of that period he returned to Cold Spring to become his 
father's successor and in 1849 the father removed to Cape May. where they 
continued practice together until 1876, when the father retired. Dr. Mrgil 
^larcy has since been alone, and for many years he has occupied a position 
of marked prestige among the representatives of the medical fraternity in 
this part of the state. He is also engaged in the drug business in connection 
with his practice, and finds it a profitable source of income. He is a meml)er 
of the County and State Medical Societies, and is a physician of rare skill 
and ability, whose large practice is an indication of the position which he 
occupies in the public confidence and regard. 

On the 19th of November, 1848, Dr. Marcy was united in marriage to 
Miss Mary Jane, a daughter of Abraham Bennett, who was a seafaring man 
and a pilot. Seven children have been born of their union: Samuel Sum- 
ner, who is engaged in the drug business, wedded Mary Moody, and they 
have two children, Samuel Sumner and Martha Grant. Henry Bennett, a 
farmer and stock dealer, married Jennie Alzina Walter, and they have three

children, — Virgil M. D., who is named for his grandfather. Fred W. antl 
Martha D., besides Frederick Avery, who died in childhood. Sarah Ben- 
nett is the wife of William H. Nelson, a grocer, of Chester, Pennsylvania, 
and they have had five children,— Joseph, Jennie, deceased, Mary, William 
Henry and Marguerite. Alexander studied medicine with his father and also 
in the University of Pennsylvania, where he was graduated. He is now en- 
gaged in practice in Riverton. New Jersey. He married Mary Ann Marcy, 
and their children are Alexander, deceased: Alexander, the second of the 
name, also deceased: Hannah A., IMargery and Reuben Sumner. Jennie 
is the wife of James E. Taylor, and they have two children,— MaiT Marcy 
and Logan B. Alvin Parker married Lizzie Fox and is a machinist in the 
Pavonia Car Shops, in Camden, New Jersey: his children are Sallie, Benja- 
min, Margaret, Virgil and Alexander: the home of the family is in Roseville, 
New Jersey. Fred Williamson, the youngest, studied medicine in the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, and is now practicing in Camden, New Jersey. 

In his political views Dr. V. U. D. Marcy has always been a stanch Demo- 
crat, unswerving in the principles of his party. He has served as township 
clerk, but has never been an aspirant for ofificial honors, preferring to devote 
his time and energies to his professional duties and the enjoyments of social 
life. He is a valued and exemplary member of the Masonic fraternity and 
for eleven consecutive years was master of his lodge. He is a man of strong 
personality, self-contained, with a quiet and persistent determination that 
overcomes obstacles and makes possible the attaining of the desired goal. 
In manner he is at once genial and kindly, yet bearing the impress of that 
dignitv which is noticealile in men who feel that they have an important life 
work to perform and who are exerting their best energies to that entl. He 
is admired throughout the country, has won respect among the medical pro- 
fession of the state and has made many warm personal friends at home and 
abroad. 



HARRY T. FORD. 

This well-known and popular citizen of Swedesboro. who succeeded his 
father, George T. Ford, as the landlord and proprietor of Ford's Hotel, 
was born in the hotel January 20, 1872. He attended the public schools 
in his boyhood, later became a pupil in Miss Halsey's private school at 
Swedesboro, and completed his education in Dixon College, at Carlisle, 
Pennsylvania. On his return home he became his father's assistant in the 
liotel. and also attended to the business of the farm. Mr. Ford is thoroughly 
familiar with all the details of hotel management, and. being naturally en- 



494 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

(lowed with a fine pliysique and a genial, obliging disposition, he makes an 
ideal landlord, as is attested by the high regard in which the Ford House 
is held by the traveling public and the people in general of southern New 
Jersey. For a short time he conducted a livery, sale and exchange stable 
in connection with the hotel, and being a great admirer of fine horses, he 
generally has one or two on hand which are good traders and '"will take no 
man's dust." 

Mr. Ford was married September 19, 1894, to \\'ilhelmina C. Rode, a 
datighter of William Rode, of Swedesboro. They have one child, Helen 
Thompson. Air. Ford is a Republican in his political views, and takes an 
interest in local afi:'airs, but does not aspire to be a politician in the ordinary 
acceptation of the term. He attends strictly to lousiness, and his friends 
predict for him success in whatever enterprise he may undertake. He does 
not belong to any fraternity, with the exception of the Heptasophs. 

In this connection it may be interesting to note something of the family 
history of Mr. Ford. His father. George T. Ford, was a son of Thomas and 
Rebecca (Paul) Ford, and was for many years engaged in farming and 
butchering at Paulsboro. and later at Swedesljoro. In 1869 he purchased 
the hotel at the latter place, and in 1875 rebuilt and refitted it. He was one 
of the leading citizens and most highly respected men of the community, and 
served his county as a member of the Board of Freeholders. He died October 
29, 1893, at the age of sixty-eight years. He w'as married three times, his sec- 
ond wife, Elizabeth Miller, being the mother of our subject. Mar\- \l. Ford, 
a sister of Harry T., is the wife of Dr. Oliver Grimshaw, of Swedesboro. 
whose sketch will be found on another page. 



JOHN. T. FRENCH. 

Investigation into the history of many of the most prominent men of 
the country will show that they have risen from lowly position; that mer- 
chant princes of our land once occupied humble clerkships: that the man- 
agers of our leading industries began their career as apprentices at a trade 
which now annually returns to them thousands of dollars, etc. The possi- 
bility of advancement which our country ofl:'ers to her amliitious young men 
is her crowning glory. Here individuality has full scope and success offers 
its rewards in return for continued and honorable effort. Mr. French is 
one who has worthily gained the proud American title of a self-made man. 
and to-day he is accounted one of the leading business representatives of At- 
lantic county, being extensively engaged in the manufacture of paints in 
Hammonton. where he is also proprietor of the Hotel Roval. 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NElf JERSEY. 495 

A native of the neighboring state of Pennsyh-ania, he was Ijorn in Dela- 
ware county, March 2, 1851, and is a son of Wilhani W. anil Ann (Airy) 
French. The father was born in Philadelphia, but removed to Trenton, Xew 
jersey, and was a representative of an old French family of this state who 
came to New Jersey early in the seventeenth century, his birth occurring 
in 181 1, and after attaining to years of maturity married Miss Airy, who 
was born in Bordentown. Nelw Jersey, in 181 5, and died in 1864. The 
father's death occurred in October. 1897. The religious faith of the family 
was that of the Society of Friends, and different male representatives of 
the name possess superior mechanical genius. 

John T. French is one of eleven children, six of whom yet survive. He 
spent his early boyhood days on his father's farm, and at the age of twelve 
years began working for wages, being employed as a farm hand till he began 
learning the painter's trade, completing his apprenticeship in 1867. He then 
commenced work as a journeyman painter, being an expert grainer. was 
eventually made a master painter, and to him was given all the responsible 
and particular work intrusted to his firm. This brought him excellent 
wages and eventually enabled him to engage in business on his own account. 
He took up his abode in Hammonton in 1877 and engaged in the painting 
business under contract for five years, taking large contracts and receiv- 
ing an extensive patronage. In 1882 he became a manufacturer of paints. 
erecting a factory forty liy thirty feet. He commenced operations on a 
small scale, expecting only to supply his own wants in that direction and to 
sell to some extent in his locality, but from the beginning the business in- 
creased and in course of time he was forced to enlarge his capacity in order 
to meet the growing demands of the trade. His sales now- amount to fifty 
thousand dollars annually and the output is shipped to all sections of the 
country. The plant is controlled and managed by himself and his sons, all 
of whom are practical manufacturers. The quality of their goods is unsur- 
passed, and this, combined with their honorable dealing, has secured to 
them a very large trade. Mr. French also does a large contracting business 
in furnishing paints, not only in New Jersey but also in Philadelphia and 
other points in that state. He also owned and operated a store in Atlantic 
City for four years and there sold large quantities of his paint. The methods 
of manufacture which he follows are equal to any in the country, and his 
business has assumed extensive proportions, bringing to him handsome 
financial returns. 

Mr. French has erected a numl^er of buildings in the town and thus con- 
tributed to the upbuilding and improvement of the place. In 1897 he 
erected the Hotel Roval, the finest hotel between Camden and Atlantic 



496 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Citv. It was Imilt with special regard to sanitary arrangements, being well 
ventilated and lighted and equipped with all the modern improvements and 
accessories. It is personally conducted by Mr. French and is one of the 
favorite resorts with the traveling public in this section of the state. 

In 1872 occurred the marriage of Mr. French and Miss Jennie R. .Alex- 
ander, a daughter of William and Amanda (Morgan) Alexander. They have 
five children living: John T., who is associated with his father in business; 
Ida F., Mrs. Wilson S. Turner; Howard C, Walter and Wilbert. 

In his political views Mr. French is a Democrat and for twenty years has 
taken an active part in promoting the interests of that organization. He was 
a member of the county commissioners for many years, has served as a 
member of the city council, as assessor and as a member of the county board 
of elections. He is now a member of the Democratic state central commit- 
tee from Atlantic county and has frequently been a delegate to the state, 
county and congressional conventions, where his counsel carried weight. 
During President Cleveland's second administration he served as post- 
master, and at all times has labored earnestly and patriotically to advance 
the welfare of the party which he believes contains the best elements of 
good government. Socially he is a representative of the N. G. Taylor Lodge, 
No. 141, F. & A. M.; Winslow Lodge, No. 40, I. O. O. F.; the Improved 
Order of Red Men. and Hammonton Council, of the Artisans' Mutual Pro- 
tective .Association. He is a man of Inroad humanitarian principles, to whom 
the cause of justice and right appeal very strongly, while oppression and 
wrong receives his earnest condemnation. In manner he is kindly and al- 
ways willing to aid those who are willing to help themselves. Charitable and 
benevolent, he gives generously but unostentatiously to those in need, and 
his social qualities are such as to win him friends where\-er he goes. 



SAMUEL SALISBURY. 



Samuel Salisbury, a retired farmer living in Swedesboro, was born on the 
farm near Pedrickston, in Logan township. Salem county, March 12. 1844. 
and his parents were Samuel and Elizabeth (Stansbury) Salisbury. The fam- 
ily was of English lineage and was founded in America by the great-grand- 
father of our subject, who left his native England and crossed the Atlantic to 
the New- World, taking up his abode in Woodstown, New Jersey, at an early 
period in the development of this state. He had two children, Joseph and 
Samuel. The former was for many years engaged in agricultural pursuits 
in Woolwich township, Gloucester county, where his death occurred. He 
married Miss Hannah Noble, a daughter of William Noble, who was of Irish

extraction, and they have the following children: Benjamin; Joseph; Samuel; 
Charles; Noble; Sarah, the wife of Samuel Leap; Hannah, the wife of John 
G. Smith; and Caroline, the wife of Joseph Gamble. 

Of this family Samuel Salisbury was married in 1838, to Miss Elizabeth 
Stansbury. a daughter of James and Sarah Stansbury, by whom he had seven 
children: Hannah and Elizabeth, both deceased; Samuel of this review; 
Benjamin, who has passed away; Charles, who resides in Paulsboro, New 
Jersey; Kate, the wife of the Hon. Harry Londenslager, of Paulsboro; Mehs- 
sa, deceased, in her life-time the wife of Frank Green; and Caddie, who died 
at the age of two years. The mother of these children was called to her 
final rest in 1862, and in 1865 Mr. Salisbury was again married, his second 
union being with Miss Susanna W. Egee, who died in 1876. He was married 
in- 1883 to Mrs. Maria Nolan, who is still living. Though left an orphan at 
an early age, Mr. Salisbury overcame all the dii^culties and obstacles in his 
path and worked his way upward to success, becoming a prosperous agricul- 
turist. In 1856 he purchased a farm which he operated until 1880, when 
he retired from active life. He died in Paulsboro in 1886, at the age of sev- 
enty-three years, and in his death the community lost one of its valued citi- 
zens. In his political afifiliations he was a Democrat and held several town- 
ship ofifices, discharging his duty in a most capable manner. Both he and 
his wife were consistent members of the ^Methodist Episcoi^al church and 
were people of the highest respectability. 

Samuel Salisbury was educated in the public schools of Paulsboro and 
assisted his father on the home farm until 1S68, when he began farming 
on his own account. He engaged in the operation of a farm for Henry 
Allen, his father-in-law, between the years 1874 and 1880, and at the latter 
date purchased a tract of land a mile north of Swedesboro on the Woodbury 
pike. There he remained until 1891, when he removed to Swedesboro and 
erected his present beautiful residence. 

On the 23d of March. 1880, Mr. Salisbury was united in marriage to ^Nliss 
Maria F. Allen, a daughter of Henry and Catherine (Fish) Allen, of Cloumell. 
They have had two children: Henry A., who is now a student in Bucknell Uni- 
versitv, and Samuel S.. who died at the age of five years. Mr. SaHsbury is a 
member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, and his wife belongs 
to the Protestant Episcopal church. In politics he is a Democrat, but has 
never been an aspirant for political honors or emoluments. He is a man of 
strict integrity, well and favorably known in Gloucester county, and his life 
illustrates what can be accomplished through determined effort, perseverance 
and good management. Such men form the bulwark of the nation. 



498 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

R. J. BYRNES. 

The man-ellous growth of Hammonton, New Jersey, largely stands as a 
monument to the enterprise and progressive spirit of Judge R. J. Byrnes; 
for through his efforts in its behalf its commercial and industrial interests 
have been advanced and many measures for the public good have been pro- 
moted. Gratitude is certainly due to the man who gives of his means to 
adorn and beautify a locality, and he may well be termed a benefactor who 
promotes business activity, for thereon rests the happiness and well-being 
of the people. No name is more inseparably associated with the growth 
and substantial development of Hammonton than that of Judge Byrnes, and 
his life history is certainly an interesting one, for it exemplifies the truth of 
the statement that success is not a matter of genius, but is the outcome of 
the faithful pursuit of a laudable purpose. 

He was born in Philadelphia, on the 22d of February, 1830. His ma- 
ternal grandfather, Robert Fleming, the emigrant, on crossing the Atlantic 
to America, took up his abode in Trenton, New Jersey, where he worked 
at the cabinet-maker's trade. His wife was a native of Philadelphia and his 
daughter Sarah was the mother of the Judge. The father of Judge Byrnes 
was for many years a clerk in a bank in Philadelphia, owned by Stephen 
Girard. He assisted in the survey made for the Girard College of that city 
and superintended his employer's commercial interests, but gave his time 
mostly to the banking business. 

Judge Byrnes attended the grammar schools of his nati\e place, but at 
the age of ten years entered the office of the Pennsylvania Freeman, a 
publishing house in Curtis alley conducted by Merrihew and Thompson. At 
that early age he assisted in reading proof for John G. Whittier, who was 
publishing a number of his poems. Subsequently our subject attended the 
St. Augustus schools, entering the preparatory for orders in the Catholic 
church, but abandoning that plan he was graduated in the Philadelphia high 
school, at the age of sixteen years, and then entered a law office, devoting 
his time to the mastering of jurisprudence. At a later date he secured a 
position in the Mechanics' Bank of Philadelphia, and while in that institu- 
tion he served as individual and general bookkeeper, as discount clerk and 
teller, winning promotion to the last named position within six years. At 
the expiration of that period he entered into partnership with C. K. Landis 
in the real-estate business and also became a stock and note broker of Phila- 
delphia. While thus engaged he purchased extensive tracts of land in At- 
lantic, Burlington and Camden counties belonging to the Richard, Cooper, 
Charlotte Cushman and other estates. In i8s8 he turned his attention to

the development of the towns of Hammonton and otlier places, and the 
progress therein made is largely due to his efforts. 

On the 1st of March, 1879, he was appointed by Governor Beadle to the 
position of judge of the court of common pleas of Atlantic county, and by 
three consecutive appointments he was continued in that office for the long 
period of twenty consecutive years. In 1870. on the organization of the 
Hammonton Building & Loan Association, he was made the president, and 
still fills that office. He is also the president of the People's Bank of Ham- 
monton, which he was instrumental in organizing, and for which he has 
acted as the head since its formation. He is the secretary of the Hammonton 
Cranberry & Improvement Association, and was one of the founders of the 
electric-light plant. His business interests have been varied and extensive, 
yet under his able control they have been successfully carried forward. 

Judge Byrnes was married in Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1869, to 
Miss Fannie G. Atkinson, a native of Boston, and they have an extensive 
acquaintance. Judge Byrnes is a man of strong individuality and intellect- 
uality, and on account of his broad general knowledge is numbered among 
the scholarly men of the state. He has been and is in control of extensive 
business interests which in their management demand commercial ability and 
executive force. He displays keen discrimination in dealing with his fellow 
men and in carrying on these enterprises, and to-day he occupies an eminent 
place as a leader of commercial interests. His reputation is unassailable, for 
in the conduct of his extensive affairs he has ever manifested the most marked 
loyalty to the principles of justice and integrity. 



EDWARD WADDINGTON. 

This leading citizen and prominent farmer of Elsinboro township was 
born in this township JNIarch 27,, 1839, a son of Richard and Marv Ann 
(Bowen) A\'addington. He was reared on a farm and received his education 
in the public schools of his native township and of Salem. Continuing in the 
line of his early training, he has always pursued the vocation of farming and 
has occupied the farm on which he now resides since 1864. He has a well- 
tilled farm of one hundred acres, keeps a large dair}' and does a general farm- 
ing business. Mr. Waddington is a Democrat in his political views, has 
been a member of the township committee and is now a trustee of the county 
almshouse. 

In February. 1864, he was married to Mary, daughter of Daniel Hood, 
of Cumberland county. Mrs. \\'addington died July 4, 1888. Thev had 
five children: Harry, born October 17. i8'')4. is a live-stock dealer; Anna K.,

H. D. BECKETT. 



H. D. Beckett, the chief engineer at ]\Ioore Brothers" glass works, at 
Clayton, New Jersey, forms the subject of this memoir. Mr. Beckett's 
father's name was William F. Beckett, and his father's name was Johnson 
Beckett. Much connected with the history of the Beckett family appears in 
the sketch of Postmaster R. T. Beckett, which will be found in this volume; 
hence need not be repeated here. 

Our subject was born in Glassboro. New Jersey, March 28, 1853. After 
he had attended the common school and while looking about for something 
in which to engage for a livelihood, the civil-war cloud made its dark and 
horrifying appearance in the sky of our Union, and good young men were 
demanded; hence it was that our subject entered the Twenty-fourth New 
Jersey Volunteers, enlisting in September. 1861. He was in the Second 
Army Corps, the Army of the Potomac, and under General French. He 
saw hard service and was discharged after ten months. He re-enlisted, how- 
ever, in February, 1864, in the Ninth New Jersey, and was with Sherman on 
his famous march "to the sea." He remained in the army, after peace had 
been declared, to gather up the arms. etc.. and was finally honorably dis- 
charged July 29, 1865. Upon his return he immediately went into the em- 
ploy of Moore Brothers as a carpenter; later he became the chief carpenter, 
and finally became the chief engineer, and now has charge of the works. 
power and buildings. 

W'ith reference to his private life, let it be said that he is liberal toward 
the churches and is a member of the Knights of Pythias order and the Grand 
Army of the Republic. He has been commander of the latter. He was united 
in marriage to Hannah Hand in the month of January, 1867. Carl D. is their 
only child. Mrs. Beckett's father was the first postmaster and station agent 
at Clayton. 

Mr. Beckett has ever been a loyal, true citizen and may justly be proud 
of the part he took, and the sacrifice he made, that the union of states might 
be preserved. He begrudges not such service, but does not care to go 
through those long and weary marches again, or even to know that any 
American will be compelled to do as he, with hundreds of thousands of the 
brave men, did from 1861 to 1865.

JOSEPH JESSUP. 



For almost two centuries the name of Jessup has figured in connection 
with the business interests of Gloucester county and with the record of the 
county's advancement along social, intellectual and moral lines. Its repre- 
sentatives have ever been prominent and respected citizens, and no man in 
Gloucester county was more esteemed and honored for sterling worth or 
character than he whose name introduces this review. Joseph Jessup was 
born in this county. May 10, 1802, in the town of Greenwich, where he spent 
his early life. The ancestry in America can be traced back to 1737. when 
John Jessup, his great-grandfather, crossed the Atlantic from his English 
home and took up his abode in the township of Deptford, near the village 
of Woodbury. A more complete ancestral history of the Jessups is given in 
connection with the sketch of Charles Clark Jessup on another page of this 
work. From his native township Joseph Jessup removed to Harrison town- 
ship, where he became extensively engaged in agricultural pursuits, owning 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEIV JERSEY. 507 

large tracts of land. He was also connected with the lumber Jjusiness, and 
wat known as one of the county's most prosperous and enterprising residents. 
He became one of the incorporators of the Gloucester County Bank, now 
the First National Bank, and served as a member of its directorate. His 
business judgment was sound and reliable, and in the careful conduct of his 
afifairs he won a handsome competence. His integrity in commercial life 
was proverbial and in all trade transactions he was known to be most relia1:ile. 
He was deeply interested in the growth and development of the community 
and assisted its progress in every way in his power. 

Mr. Jessup was twice married. He first wedded Mary \\'ood. and unto 
them was born one child that died in infancy. After the death of his first 
wife he was joined in wedlock to Miss Mary Qark. and they became the 
parents of seven children, namely: Annie E. J.; James B.; John S.; Joseph, 
deceased: Charles C: Edward H., deceased; and Sarah, who has also passed 
away. Tlie eldest son is now a retired farmer residing in Woodstown, this 
state. John S.. the second son, has attained distinction as a member of the 
legal profession. He was born August 28, 1842, in Lincoln, Harrison town- 
ship, Gloucester county, and in the public schools acquired his primary 
education, which was supplemented by a collegiate course in the West Jersey 
Academy of Bridgeton, in which institution he was graduated in 1862. He 
then entered Princeton College and was graduated there with the class of 
1865. During the same year he began the study of law under the direction 
of Hon. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, of Newark, New Jersey, and subse- 
quently spent one year in the law department of Harvard College. He was 
admitted to the bar of New Jersey in 1868 and at once began the practice of 
his chosen profession in Woodbury. His natural ability was supplemented by 
careful and thorough preparation, and his added experience as the years have 
passed has given him marked prestige as a representative of his chosen 
calling. He is thoroughly informed in all departments of law and is recog- 
nized as a leading memljer of the bar of southern New Jersey. He was 
appointed the presiding judge of the court of common pleas on the ist of 
April, 1897, and still holds that position, which he fills with a dignity and 
abiirtv that reflect credit and honor upon himself, his office and his constit- 
uents'. He has been a member of the Woodbury city council for nine years 
and for ten years has served as the clerk and counselor of the board of free- 
holders. The Judge has also been the solicitor of the First National Bank 
of Woodbury for thirty years. He is a stanch Republican in his political 
views, but never allows party preferences to interfere with the impartial dis- 
charge of his judicial duties. He holds membership in the Presbyterian 
church. On the 2d of November, 1871. he was united in marriage to Miss 



5o8 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Mary Moore Howell, a daughter of Dr. Benjamin P. and Rachel L. Howell, 
of Woodbury. The children born to them are: Joseph, who was born Jan- 
uary 19, 1873, and is now an electrical engineer; Benjamin H., who died in 
childhood; John S.. a civil engineer; Mary H.. Rachel L.. Anna G. and 
Sarah. 

Joseph Jessup gave his political support to the Whig party in early man- 
hood and on the organization of the Republican party joined its ranks and 
continued to advocate its principles throughout the remainder of his life. He 
was never an aspirant for political honors, although he accepted the office 
of sheriff at the earnest solicitation of his friends and served for two terms. 
He worshiped with the Society of Friends, and his life, which exemplified his 
Christian faith, was characterized by uprightness and integrity that com- 
manded the respect and confidence of his fellow men wherever he was known. 
His death occurred very suddenly February 5, 1885, and his loss was mourned 
throughout the entire community. He was a man whose depth of character 
and strong adherencv to principle excited the admiration of his contem- 
poraries, and all who knew him recognized that his character was above 
reproach. 



REV. DR. JOHN EWING. 

One of the most eminent representatives of the Presbyterian clergy 
of the east is the gentleman whose name initiates this review — the present 
pastor of the Presbyterian church of Pittsgrove, at Daretown.. A man of 
broad scholarly attainments, gifted with strong intellectuality, he has devoted 
his life to this most holy calling and has been a marked power for good 
in advancing the work of the church and promoting the cause of Chris- 
tianitv among men. He was born in Ewingville, Pennsylvania, near the 
citv of Pittsburg, and is a son of James Ewing. The ancestry of the family 
can be traced back to early colonial days, when Finley Ewing crossed the 
Atlantic to the new world. He received a sword from the King of England 
in recognition of the great bravery which he displayed in the battle of 
Burgoyne. The grandfather, James Ewing, Sr., was one of the first settlers 
of Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, and built the first gristmill there. By 
the judicious management of his business interests he accumulated con- 
siderable wealth and was regarded as one of the most prominent and inthi- 
ential citizens of his community. 

Dr. Ewing spent his boyhood days in his parents" home, and supple- 
mented his early educational privileges by a course at Jefferson College, 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEIV JERSEY. 509 

now Washington and Jefferson College, where he was graduated in 1838, 
in a class of seventy-six students— the largest class that has ever been 
graduated west of the Allegheny mountains up to that time. The degree 
of Bachelor of Arts was conferred upon him. and later his alma mater 
bestowed upon him the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. 
The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him by .'Windsor 
College of Maryland— an indication of his scholarly acquirements and his 
eminent position in ministerial circles. 

Determining to devote his life to the proclamation among men of the 
glad tidings of great joy. he matriculated in the Allegheny Presbyterian 
Theological Seminary and was graduated in 1861. His first pastorate was 
over Trinity church, in Philadelphia. Through his instrumentality the 
house of worship was erected, and he remained in charge of the congrega- 
tion from 1862 until 1869, when he accepted a call from the church in 
Clinton, New Jersey, where he remained until 1882. During that time 
the present governor of New Jersey was a scholar in the Sunday-school. 
On leaving Clinton he accepted the pastorate of the Presbyterian church 
in Plymouth, Pennsylvania, where he continued two years, and on the ist 
of September, 1885, he came to the Pittsgrove Presbyterian church, at 
Daretown, where he has now remained for fifteen years. His church asso- 
ciations here are very pleasant. He has the largest congregation in the 
county, and the various departments of the church work are in a very 
flourishing condition. In the pulpit he is a fluent and entertaining speaker, 
profound in his reasoning, logical in his deductions and convincing in argu- 
ment. He has that broad general knowledge and culture which only travel 
can bring, and his reminiscences of Europe and the Holy Land enrich 
and adorn his discourses, making them both instructive and entertaining. 
In 1874 he went abroad as a delegate from the Presbyterian church of 
the United States to the general assembly of the church of Scotland and 
delivered one of the most able addresses before that assemblage. He 
has also, visited many places of historic and modern interest on the continent 
and has traveled amid the scenes of Palestine, made sacred by the holy 
associations connected therewith. 

■ At this point it would be almost tautological to enter into any series of 
statements as showing Dr. Ewing to be a man of broad intelligence and 
genuine public spirit, for these have been shadowed forth between the lines 
of this review. Strong in his individuality, he never lacks the courage of 
his convictions, but there are as dominating elements in this individuality 
a lively human sympathy and an abiding charity, which, as taken in con- 



5IO 



BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 



nection with the sterling integrity and honor of his character, have natm-aUy 
gained to Dr. Ewing the respect and confidence of men. 

PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF I'lTTSGROVE. 

The Pres1)vterian Church of Pittsgrove, located at Daretown, New 
Jersey, has been in existence for more than one hinidred and fifty years. 
April 30, 1 74 1, has generally been accepted as the date of its organiza- 
tion, although there was a congregation formed prior to that time, services 
being held at inter\-als. More or less trouble occurred in the church and 
the society was not regularly under the superintendence of the presbytery 




until about 1741. At a date not known a house for public worship was 
erected by the congregation not far from the village of Woodston, but it 
was neglected, and fell into decay soon after the year 1740. About the 
beginning of May, 1740, the Rev. David Evans, of Tredyffrin, in Pennsyl- 
vania, began to preach for the congregation, and soon after assumed pas- 
toral charge. On the 30th of April, 1741, he formed and organized a 
Presbyterian church, when forty-nine members were admitted to the enjoy- 
ment of the special ordinances of the gospel. About the time of the arrival 
of Mr. Evans a new meeting house was erected on the site of the present 
house of worship. He continued to officiate in the ministry there until 
November, 1750, during which time he received to the communion of the 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 511 

church one hundred and fourteen persons and baptized two hundred and 
eighty-four. He was succeeded in the pastorate, December 12, 1752, by 
the Rev. Neliemiah Greenman, who was ordained December 5, 1753, and 
during his ministry the present church edifice was erected. While he 
continued in the pastorate there he baptized three hundred persons, and 
the congregation greatly increased in numbers and also greatly increased 
its property holdings. 

The Rev. William Schenck, the third pastor of the congregation, was 
installed May 3, 1780, did good work for the church, and at length was 
dismissed on account of his failing health, in 1786. His successor was the 
Rev. Isaac Foster, who became pastor of the church in June, 1790. He 
was followed by Rev. Samuel Laycock, October 22, 1794, and he was suc- 
ceeded, June 4, 1799, by Rev. Buckley Carll, who remained in charge of 
the church for three and a half years. The next regular minister was Rev. 
Hezekiah North Woodruff, and he was followed by Rev. John Clark, who 
took charge of the congregation in February, 1806. In April, 1807, he 
reported ninety-five communicants. He retired from that pastorate the 
following year, and until 181 2 the church was without a regular minister. 
The next to accept the pastorate was Rev. G. W. Janvier, who had charge 
of the congregation for nearly forty-seven yearst — a period of great pros- 
perity to the church, and one mutually helpful, beneficial and pleasant to 
pastor and people. When he assumed charge the membership was ninety- 
eight, and at the time of his resignation was five hundred and forty-seven. 
He was a cultured gentleman, and his politeness was proverbial. As 
pastor, preacher and presbyter, he was justly held in high esteem. He took 
a lively interest in the afifairs of the church and country, was a faithful 
friend and a wise counsellor. 

The next pastor was the Rev. Edward Patrick Shields, D.D., who was 
installed in June, 1858. In the spring of 1863 the congregation decided 
to build a new church, but it was not until August 11, 1867, that it was 
dedicated. Rev. Dr. Shields remained in charge of the Pittsgrove church 
for nearly thirteen years, and was highly appreciated and greatly beloved by 
the entire congregation. He was succeeded by the Rev. William A. Fer- 
guson, in 1 87 1. The last named was a gentleman of scholarly attainments, 
a graduate of the Princeton Theological Seminary, a faithful pastor and 
an excellent preacher. The church grew rapidly under his care, and he 
continued at its head until 1881, when he removed to Marysville, Ohio. 
The next pastor was the Rev. J. D. Randolph, who was installed June 15, 
1882. He was a very able minister, but tendered his resignation in April, 
1884. and in August of that year his pastoral relation with the Pittsgrove 



512 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

church was discontinued. On the 13th of October. 1885, Rev. John Ewing, 
D.D., was installed as pastor, and has since been in charge of the church. 
his work being most acceptable. The cliurch has grown in numbers, 
strength and influence under his care and is now the largest congregation 
in the countv. 



S. D. LODGE. 



More than a century has passed since the ancestors of S. D. Lodge left 
their home in England and crossed the x\tlantic to America, taking up their 
abode in Greenwich township, Gloucester count)', on the bank of the Dela- 
ware river. Property was there purchased and the family remained in that 
locality for many vears. Joseph Lodge, the grandfather, engaged in shad 
fishing on a river at that place. His son. Joseph, the father of our subject, 
was born in Greenwich township and removed to Mantua in 1829. He en- 
gaged in merchandising and also in shipping cord-wood to Philadelphia. 
In 1842. however, he took up his abode upon a farm in this locality, where 
he made his home until his death, which occurred in 1864. He served as a 
commissioner of deeds and was at one time a candidate for the state legisla- 
ture. The cause of temperance found in him a zealous advocate and he 
was largely instrumental in advancing its interests. He married Amanda 
Dare, a daughter of Samuel Dare, of Daretown, Salem county. She died 
in 1893. and three of her four children survive her, namely: Fanny, who is 
living in Philadelphia; Kate, the wife of A. H. Moses, of that city; and S. D. 

Mr. Lodge, of this review, pursued his education in the common schools 
and afterward engaged in teaching for two years in this neighborhood. He 
was born in Mantua, in 1833, and has passed his entire life in this locality. 
He engaged in farming for some years after attaining his majority and is still 
the owner of sixty acres of farming land, constituting one of the best farms 
in the county. In 1887 he took up his abode in Mantua, where he purchased 
a place. He is also engaged to some extent in the real-estate business, and 
draws up many wills for people in this locality. His business interests are 
ably conducted and have brought to him creditable success. 

In 1856 Mr. Lodge married Sarah Eastlock, a daughter of John Eastlock, 
of this locality. Three children were born to them, of whom two are living; 
Rolla, a graduate of Drexler Institute, and now a civil engineer of Philadel- 
phia; and Annie, the wife of J. R. Wilson, of Philadelphia. In his political 
views Mr. Lodge is a Democrat and his fellow townsmen recognize his 
worth and ability, frequently calling him to public office. He has served in 
all the township positions, being clerk of the town when only twenty -one 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 513 

years of age. For seventeen years he has served as township collector, and 
what higher testimony could be given? He is a progressive and pubhc- 
spirited citizen and takes a deep interest in everything pertaining to the 
welfare of the community. 



FRANKLIN LIPPINCOTT. 

Franklin Lippincott, a well-known veterinary surgeon and farmer of 
Woolwich township, Gloucester county, New Jersey, is a native of this state, 
born at Gibbstown, June 10, 1846, and is a representative of a family whose 
residence in this county covers the past century. 

Dr. Lippincott is a son of Howell and Ann (Styles) Lippincott, his 
mother's widowed name having been Pancoast. His grandparents, George 
and Tacey (Lippincott) Lippincott, came to Greenwich township, Gloucester 
county, soon after 1800 and reared four children: Howell; Hannah, the wife 
of Jonathan Bennett, of Swedesboro; Mary, the wife of Enos Stretch, of 
Gibbstown; and Sarah, the wife of Isaac Warner of Paulsboro. Howell 
Lippincott was a school-teacher. He died in 1848, at the age of thirty-five 
years, leaving two children: William, who died at the age of eight years, and 
Franklin, the subject of this sketch. 

Franklin received his education in the Chestnut Hill and Clarksboro pub- 
lic schools of Greenwich township and in the Gloucester high school, and 
pursued his studies in veterinarv.surgery under the instructions of Peter F; 
Locke, whose father and grandfather were veterinary surgeons. Thus be- 
sides the ordinary means of acquiring text-book theories. Dr. Lippincott had 
an opportunity of obtaining the practical knowledge of the art and science 
of veterinary surgery, which came of three generations of practice and pro- 
fessional observation. In the practice of his profession he has been very 
successful, and in addition to meeting the demands of his practice, traveling 
over a large territory, he carries on farming operations. Nine years he 
resided on the Judge Thompson farm and during the past fifteen years has 
occupied his present place, known as the John K. Clark estate. 

Dr. Lippincott married Miss Josephine Casperson, a daughter of Samuel 
L. Casperson, a Delaware river captain; and the fruits of their union have 
been seven children, namely: Harriet, a trained nurse, of Philadelphia; 
Lizzie, at home; Samuel, who died in childhood; Margaret, a school- 
teacher; Ada and Ida, twins, the latter the wife of Charles Fedzer, of Man- 
tua, New Jersey, and they have one son, Franklin Lewis, and Dora, who is 
still in school.

PETER VAX VOORHEES. 

Whatever else may be said of the legal fraternity, it cannot be denied 
that members of the bar have been more important actors in public aftairs 
than any other class of American people. The lawyer stands as the pro- 
tector of the rights and liberties of his fellow men. and is the representative 
of a profession whose followers, if they would gain honor, fame and success, 
must be men of merit and ability. Such a one is Mr. Van Voorhees, who 
is now serving as the judge of the Court of Errors and Appeals, winning 
high commendation bj" his fair and impartial administration of justice. 

The Judge was bom in North Brunswick township, near New Bruns- 
wick, Middlesex county. New Jersey. June i8, 1852. and is a son of John 
S. and Sarah S. (Van Doren) Voorhees. On both sides he is of Holland 
descent, and is connected with one of the oldest and most prominent families 
of New Jersey. On the paternal side he traces his ancestr}' back to Count 
Albert Van X'oorhees. whose son, Stephen Coerte Van Voorhees, was the 
founder of the family in America, having emigrated from Holland in April. 
1660. 

During his boyhood Judge Voorhees attended the grammar school of 
New Brunswick, and in 1869 entered Rutgers College, where he was gradu- 
ated with the degree of A.B. in 1873. receiving the degree of A.M. three 
years later. He commenced the study of law with Peter L. Voorhees. of 
Camden, and was admitted to the New Jersey bar as an attorney in 1876 and 
as a counsellor in 1879. He was then associated in practice with his pre- 
ceptor until the latter's death, in 1895. a period of nearly twenty years. 
To-day the Judge is one of the ablest members of the Camden bar, and 
during his professional life has always enjoyed the respect and confidence 
of not only his fellow lawyers, but also of the public, He has made a 
specialty of railroad and corporation law, in which he is well versed, and 
in these lines has gained a most enviable reputation. He has also been 
conspicuous in other departments of the profession. He is a lawj'er of 
the highest rank, and a most persuasive and powerful advocate. On the 
6th of March, 1900, he was appointed judge of the Court of Errors and 
Appeals, succeeding Judge Nixon, who resigned, and is now most creditably 
filling that oflfice. In business affairs the Judge has also met with success, 
and is to-day a director of the Camden Deposit & Trust Company, of the 
First National Bank of Camden, and of the West Jersev Title & Guarantee

Company. He is also one of the managers of the Cooper Hospital, a 
trustee of tlie Cooper estate, and a vestryman of St. Paul's Episcopal 
Church of Camden, and he takes quite an active interest in public affairs. 

On the 2ist of April, 1881, Judge Voorhees was united in marriage with 
Miss Louisa C. Dayton, a daughter of James B. and Louisa (Clarke) Dayton, 
of Camden. 



SHEPPARD HARRIS. 



Sheppard Harris was born in Salem county. New Jersey, September 22, 
1838, a son of Silas and Elizabeth (Ireland) Harris, both. of whom were 
natives of this county. The paternal grandfather was Sheppard Harris and 
the maternal grandfather, Benjamin Ireland, and both represented old fami- 
lies of this county. The father of our subject was engaged in farming until 
185 1, when he began the manufacture of lumber, operating a sawmill for 
some time at Penn Grove, New Jersey. He died in 1877, at the age 
of sixty-eight years, and his widow survived till 1900. passing the eighty- 
third milestone on life's journey. In their family were five children, namely: 
Benjamin I., Sheppard, Mary W., Annie E. and Harriet R. 

Sheppard Harris spent the first thirteen years of his life on a farm in 
Lower Alloway Creek township and for seven years thereafter was a resident 
of Penn Grove, but since his twenty-first year his home has been in Salem. 
He attended the Friends' school of this city and in 1858 began teaching, 
which profession he followed for five years with excellent success. He after- 
ward engaged in the manufacture of brushes for a short time and subse- 
quently was in the grocery and butchering business, in which he continued 
until 1895, since which time he has been in the office of the South Jersey- 
man. 

Mr. Harris has long been recognized as one of the leading and representa- 
tive citizens of his community and has taken an active part in many move- 
ments and measures which have contributed to the public good. He was on 
the election board for several years and for ten years was the secretary of the 
Salem board of education. The school system has ever found in him a warm 
friend, and during his incumbency he gave his active support toward the 
erection of the new Walnut street school and toward the advancement of 
every measure that he believed would promote the educational interests of 
the city. During his interval of teaching, in the year 1859. he accepted a 
position as clerk in a general store at Bridgeport with .A. A. Jordan for a 
short time. Spirituous liquors were sold at that time in all such stores, 
ostensibly for medicinal purposes but really as a beverage. During his short 



5i6 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

stay with Mr. Jordan he succeeded in effectually persuading him to discon- 
tinue the traffic, much to the satisfaction of the Christian communit}'. 
Twelve years later he was the bookkeeper for P. S. Hill & Company in 
Paschallville, who had a large general stoce with a lumber-yard, stone quarry, 
brick-yard, etc., doing a large business. Spirituous liquors were largely sold 
in them also, much to his disgust. Twelve years later he had a similar expe- 
rience, with the same success, with P. S. Hill & Company, of Paschallville, 
Pennsylvania, who had a large general store, lumber-yard, brick-yard and 
stone quarry, for whom he was a bookkeeper. He was the first to advocate 
the teaching of music in the public schools in Salem, and which has since 
proved to be a good thing. He holds membership in the First Methodist 
Episcopal church, has served as a member of its ofificial board and was a 
member of its building committee during the erection of the new church in 
1887. Socially he is connected with Fenwick Lodge, No. 164, I. O. O. F., 
Salem Lodge, No. 37, A. O. U. W., Salem Conclave, L O. H., Salem Di- 
vision of the Sons of Temperance and the Good Templars society during 
their existence in Salem. In church and temperance work he takes a very 
.active interest and for a long period has served as a teacher in the Sunday- 
school. He withholds his support from no movement or measure which 
he believes will promote the public welfare and uplift humanity, and his labors 
have been productive of great good. 

Li 1863 occurred the marriage of Mr. Harris and Miss Sarah Casperson, 
of Pennville, a daughter of John and Elizabeth (Powers) Casperson, both 
representatives of prominent families of Salem county, New Jersey. She 
was born March 20, 1837, and by her marriage has become the mother of 
five children: S. Virginia, who died at the age of twenty-two years; William 
H., the editor of "The South Jerseyman"; Mary C, the wife of John E. 
Zaiser, of Salem; Albert C, who is employed as a salesman in a grocery store 
in .Atlantic City, New Jersey; and Frank S., who is connected with "The 
South Jerseyman." In all life's relations Mr. Harris has been found honor- 
able and straightforward and has ever commanded the respect and confidence 
of all with whom he has been associated. His record is indeed worthy of 
emulation and he well deserves mention in this volume. 



H. C. THOMPSON. 



There are always men in every community who by reason of strong in- 
dividuality and superior ability occupy a leading position in business circles 
and public affairs, and yet who in manner are unostentatious, making no 
claims upon pulilic favor. Such a one is Mr. Thompson. True merit, how- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 517 

ever, cannot be obscured and is bound to win recognition, for the public is 
a discriminating factor and bestows its sincere regard only where it is de- 
served. Mr. Thompson is prominently connected with the business affairs 
of Cape May as cashier and agent of the New Jersey Trust & Safety Deposit 
Company, and is a reliable and progressive business man whose success in 
life is due entirely to his own efforts. 

A native of this city, he was born October 31, 1851, his parents being 
Richard R. and Anna S. (Hand) Thompson. His paternal grandfather. Rich- 
ardson Thompson, Sr., was born in Washington, D. C. acquiring a liberal 
education and learned the tailor's trade, later being a member of the firm of 
Tuck & Thompson, proprietors of the leading tailoring establishment of the 
capital city, receiving the patronage of the most prominent people of Wash- 
ington. He was also a local minister of the Methodist Episcopal church 
and was one of the founders of the Wesley Chapel at the corner of Fifth and 
F streets, where many of the distinguished statesmen of the nation worshiped. 
He was very liberal and generous with his means in church organization and 
to charities, and withheld his support from no movement which he believed 
would uplift and benefit mankind. His last days were spent in Washington, 
where he was held in highest regard, having the warm friendship of many 
of the most noted men of the country in his day. 

One of his children was John, who was in the government employ in 
Washington. During the civil war he served in the Union army with an 
Ohio regiment and participated in a number of the important engagements, 
and was wounded in the battle of Shiloh, and also having a son killed at his 
side. After his return he occupied a position in the United States treasury 
and auditing departments, and at one time was the editor of a paper in the 
west, but spent his last days in the capital city. Wesley, the second of the 
family, held a public position in one of the governmental departments, and 
died in Baltimore. He had a son who was killed in the battle of Shiloh. 
Richard, the father of our subject, was the next of the family. Belle became 
the wife of Richard Cooney, of the treasury department of Washington, 
D. C, and their son Thomas married a niece of President McKinley. Laura 
became the wife of Walter \\'illiams, a prominent citizen of Washington. 
Darby never married. Sarah, married a Mr. Connelly, who was a wealthy 
slaveholder of Maryland and resided in Washington. Mary became the 
wife of Frank Espey, who was employed in the government service in \\'ash- 
ington. 

Richard Thompson, the father of our subject, was born in Petersbyrg, 
Virginia, and at the age of fourteen left school and entered upon his business 
career. For many years he was engaged in the hotel business and in this 



5i8 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

connection l)ecame widely known tliroughout tlie country. Before the war 
he was associated with Colonel John West as the proprietor of the Congress 
Hall Hotel at Cape May, and during the hostilities between the north and the 
south he was the manager of the Metropolitan Hotel in Washington. Sub- 
sequentl}' he conducted the Owen House in Washington. D. C. the Ban- 
croft House in New York city and the Kimball House in Atlanta, Georgia. 
He then returned to Cape May. where the residue of his days was passed. 
He gave his political support to the Democratic party and served as a mem- 
ber of the city council, but never sought political preferment. He is a promi- 
nent IMason and was one of the first members of Cape Island Lodge, No. 37, 
A. F. & A. M. He also belonged to the Presbyterian church, and was a man 
who received and merited the regard and confidence of all with whom he 
came in contact, and his acquaintance was very wide. His children were 
eight in luunber, Henry C. being the eldest. Richard H., the second, is 
engaged in business in New York city, married Sadie Martin, and they have 
two children. George and Richard. Jourdan M. married May Clements, a 
daughter of Rev. Clements, and is engaged in business in Philadelphia. 
John \\'. is the next of the family. Samuel B. is now deceased. William H. 
now resides at Cape May in charge of the Stockton Hotel. He is married 
and has one child. Emily. Joseph L.. of Philadelphia, married Emily Wilder- 
muth and has two children, — Albert and Russell. Annie, the youngest of 
the family, died in childhood. The father of this family died at the age of 
fifty-five years, and the mother when about fifty-three years of age. 

Henry C. Thompson, having acquired his preliminary education in the 
public schools of Cape May. supplemented that course by studying in Gon- 
zaga College, in Washington. D. C. one of the leading schools of that city. 
He entered upon his business career in the capacity of a clerk and subse- 
quently was employed as a bookkeeper. On the 5th of July. 1887. he was 
made the cashier and agent of the New Jersey Trust & Safety Deposit Com- 
pany at Cape May. This enterprise was organized in that year and is sup- 
plied witli all banking facilities. The success of the undertaking is due to Mr. 
Thompson, whose powers of management and executive al)ility have been 
the factors that have secured its prosperity. 

Mr. Thompson married Miss Linda M.. a daughter of Dr. James F. Ken- 
nedy, for many years a prominent physician at Cape May, and a leading citi- 
zen who at various times served as an alderman. His father was James 
Schellinger Kennedy, who made his home in Philadelphia but was a captain 
of a vessel and was lost at sea. Dr. Kennedy married Charlotte Swain, and 
their children were: Henry A., who graduated at the Jefferson Medical 
College and is a physician at Cape May: James, who died at the age of 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEIV JERSEY. 5i9 

about fifteen years; and Mrs. Thompson. Her father was a very prominent 
church ^vorker and was one of the founders of the Presbyterian church at 
this place. His life was a busy, useful and honorable one and the respect 
which is uniformly accorded to true worth was given him. 

Unto Mr and Mrs. Thompson have been born four children.— Anna b., 
Charlotte K.. Eleanor H. and Richard R. The eldest daughter is now a 
pupil of Miss Whinnery, of Philadelphia, and is a fine vocalist. Charlotte 
K has exceptional talent as a pianist and has studied under the famous 
Richard Zeckwer. of Philadelphia. The daughter Eleanor also has a finely 
cultivated voice and is many times solicited to aid in entertainments given in 
the city Mrs. Thompson also possesses superior musical ability and for 
manv xears engaged in teaching her art in Cape May. The talent of the 
famiiv'in this regard makes their home particularly attractive, and the 
Thompson household is the center of the cultured society circles. 

In his political views Mr. Thompson is independent. He has served as 
city recorder and was superintendent of the water-works for eight years. He 
is also a member of the Improved Order of Heptasophs, and was formerly a 
member of the Sixth Regiment of the New Jersey National Guards. Hold- 
ing a membership in the Methodist Episcopal church, he is deeply interested 
in^its growth and upbuilding and has served as a class-leader. Thus in the 
various avenues of life he is found identified with the interests which tend to 
improve social, material, intellectual and moralHfe, and Cape May numbers 
him among its most progressive and valuable citizens.

J. CHARLES RIGHTER. 

There is a vast field open to those who care to enter commercial life. 
In military and political circles there is but little opportunity to gain leading 
positions, but in the world of trade one may reach a place of prominence 
and exert a wide influence on the affairs which afifect the material pros- 
perity of the community. The development, growth and progress of every 
town and city depends upon its commercial activity, and the leading mer- 
chants are those to whom is due the advancement of the municipal corpora- 
tions which they represent. ^Ir. Righter is actively connected with the 
business interests of Salem as a wholesale and retail dealer in hardware and 
oil, and as he has a wide acquaintance this sketch will constitute a source 
of interest to many of the readers of this volume. 

Mr. Righter's great-grandfather, John Righter, was a native of Hesse, 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 521 

Germany, whence he came to America early in the eighteenth century, 
setthng at Mill Creek, in Lower Marion township, Pennsylvania. He was 
an extensive land-owner and owned and operated several paper and flour 
mills in that vicinity and became a prominent and wealthy citizen. He 
possessed great force of character and exerted a strong influence for good 
in the community. His first wife was a Quaker lady named Levering. 
John Righter adopted the language and dress of the Friends, though he 
never became a member of the society. His second wife was Jane McFee. 
a member of the Baptist church. He lived to be almost a centenarian and 
is buried in the Baptist church yard at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. There 
were several childi-en of the second marriage, one of them being John 
Righter, Jr., the grandfather of the subject of this sketch. He married 
Eupheniia Wilson, a lady of the Presbyterian faith, whose father. Lieutenant 
William W. Wilson, was a member of the same jMasonic lodge that General 
Washington was connected with, and which the latter visited. John 
Righter, the second, was associated in business with his father and showed 
great executive ability, but died at the early age of twenty-nine, though 
not before he had become a prominent and influential man. His widow 
lived until she had passed the age of four-score years, dying in 1871. Unto 
John and Euphemia Righter were born three children : Jane, who married 
Dr. McKay; William, a practicing physician first in Berwick and after- 
ward in Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania; and John W., the father of our subject. 
John W. Righter, the third of that name, was born in Lower Marion 
township, Montgomery county, Pennsylvania, in 18 19. and received his 
education in a private school in that state. He, too, had a liking for the 
milling business, owning and operating a mill in Butler Valley, Luzerne 
county, Pennsylvania, and also powder and saw mills elsewhere. He resided 
in Beaver Meadow, Carbon county, Pennsylvania, and in the midst of a 
prosperous business career was suddenly stricken by death, dying at the 
age of thirty-six, in February, 1856. He was married to Margaretta Wood- 
nutt Hall, who still survives him, being a pleasant, cheery lady of eighty-five 
years. They were the parents of four children : Elizabeth Woodnutt; James 
Hall, connected with the hardware business in Philadelphia, who married 
Hannah Gamewell, and of their children but one, Margaret Woodnutt, is 
living; William Woodnutt, engaged in silver-mining in Mexico; and John 
Charles, our subject. John Righter was a Democrat and gave valuable aid 
toward seating Asa Packer in congress. He was a prominent member of 
the Masonic and Odd Fellows lodges, was a good, upright man, generous 
and forbearing in disposition, and will long be remembered by those who 
knew him for his many worthy qualities. 



522 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

On the maternal side Mr. Righter is descended from equally honorable 
parentage, tracing his ancestry back to some of the oldest families in the 
country. In the year 1677 William Hall came to this country with other 
members of the Fenwick colony. He is called in the list of emigrants a 
■'servant." but viewed in the light of subsequent events this can scarcely 
have been correct, or if so, William Hall must have been a man of un- 
common ability to rise from such a humble position to become in the course 
of a few years recorder, burgess, judge, and, what was of still greater im- 
portance, a member of the governor's council. He was an extensive land- 
owner and established the first store in Salem. He belonged to the Society 
of Friends, which religious organization was then greatly persecuted in 
England, its members being deprived of their property and liberty until 
thev were glad to leave the country on any terms. Those who had lost 
their monev were obliged to borrow from those in better circumstances in 
order to pav their passage, repaying it by some sort of service on their 
arrival. Such were classed under the general term of "servants," yet many 
of them became eminent citizens. William Hall was married in 1686 to 
Elizabeth Pyle, whose family name was given to the township of Piles 
Grove. She died in 1699, leaving several children, and in 1700 William 
Hall married Sarah Clement, and from their three sons — William, Qement 
and Nathaniel — the various branches of the Hall family in southern New 
Jersey are descended. Sarah Clement was a granddaughter of Gregory 
Clement, one of the regicide judges of Charles I, who sufifered, under 
Charles H, the awful penalty for "treason," as the offense was termed. 
Judge Hall died about 1713. and his wife survived him several years, 
managing her large estate with excellent judgment, her husband leaving 
"all his property, both real and personal, to his beloved wife, Sarah Hall." 
Clement Hall, the second son, married and settled in Delaware, and there 
are some of his descendants in the Acton family that bear the name at the 
present time. 

Nathaniel Hall, a son of Edward Hall, was an officer in the Revolu- 
tionary army and won the title of colonel. His third wife was Nancy Darrah, 
and he was her third husband. Her mother was Lydia Darrah, of Revo- 
lutionary fame, who was instrumental in saving the American army from 
destruction at Germantown. On one occasion she fastened a sword on 
the back of her daughter, Ann, underneath her clothing, and sent her to 
convey the weapon to her son. who was in Washington's army. It was 
necessary to pass through the British lines in order to reach her destina- 
tion, and when the young girl applied to one of the ofificers for the requisite 
permission he gave it, saying, "You are too pretty to go to the rebel army." 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 523 

The hand almost rested on the sword, and had the weapon lieen discovered 
it would probably have gone hard with the little maiden. The Jameses, 
the Millers and other Salem families are descended from Nathaniel Hall. 

Judge Hall's eldest son, William Hall, Jr., married Elizabeth Smith, of 
Amblebury. Their eldest son, Clement, was married in 1748 to Margaret, 
a daughter of Joseph Morris, of Elsinboro, a granddaughter of Hedroe or 
Ruthera Morris, who came from Pembrokeshire, Wales, in 1683. The 
children of Clement and Margaret (Morris) Hall were Ann, Sarah, Clement, 
John, Joseph, Morris and Margaret. Clement Hall died in 1772, his wife 
surviving him ten years, and the ability with which she managed her 
property indicated that she had great business talent. Margaret Morris 
Hall was a granddaughter of Manning Braithwaite, gentleman, and a great- 
granddaughter of William and Joane (Le Fevre) Braithwaite. The Le 
Fevres were a Huguenot family driven from France by the revocation of 
the edict of Nantes by Louis XIV. They settled in England and afterward 
came to New Jersey. A short time previously John Fenwick had pur- 
chased a large tract of land and a portion of this he sold to the Le Fevre 
family. Hypolite Le Fevre, gentleman, and his son Hypolite, were the 
first of the name to locate in New Jersey. Ann Le Fevre was first married 
to John Worlidge, a prominent member of the Fenwick colony, and after 
his death to William Braithwaite, Jr. Hypolite Le Fevre, Jr., married 
Hannah Carll, of Philadelphia, and settled in Delaware. The original will 
of Joane Braithwaite, written in 1679. is now in the possession of one of 
her descendants of the sixth generation and is very quaint. It reads: 

"In the name of God, Amen : I, Joane Braithwaite, of ye county of 
Salem, in ye province of \^''est Jersey — widdow — being sick and weake of 
body, but of perfect sence and memory, praise be to God, Doo make and 
ordaine this my last will and testament, etc. First I give and Bequeathe 
my soule into ye hands of Almighty God that gave it me hopeing through 
his mercie and ye meritts of ye Sa\iour Jesus Christ to receive pardon of 
my sins. I give my body to ye earth hopeing a joyfull Resurrection of ye 
same, and desiring ye it may be Decently buried att ye Discretion of mv 
Executor hereafter named." 

She gave to her stepson, or as he was called in those days, son-in-law, 
William Braithwaite, among other things "three gold rings, that is to say, 
a wedding ring, a plaine ring and a stone ring; also one silver seall, cut 
thereon a wounded hart." "I will, give and Bequeathe unto my son Man- 
ning Braithwaite. ye housing and plantation whereon I now dwelleth, 
together with all ye lands thereunto belonging," etc. It is sealed with the

above mentioned "wounded liart," "on this four and twentietli day of 
January M, one thousand six hundred and ninety-seven." 

Clement Hall, Jr., a son of Clement and Margaret (I\Iorris) Hall, was 
married about 1789 to Rebecca, a daughter of Joseph and Ann Kay. nf 
Gloucester county. Their children were named as follo\\s : Ann. the eldest. 
married Samuel N. Tliompson, and their children were Samuel, Joshua, 
Isaac, Sarah Ann and Clement; Margaret Morris married John Holme, and 
their children were Benjamin, Jane and Caroline, the latter dying in child- 
hood; Morris married Elizabeth Woodnutt and had four children who lived 
to maturity; Prudence Hall became the w'ife of Joseph Ogden; Sarah died 
unmarried; Deborah Kay married Samuel D. Ingham, of Pennsylvania, for 
his second wife, and their children were Eliza, Rebecca, William Armstrong 
and Mary Louisa; Rebecca Kay became the second wife of John Sinnick- 
son, and their children are John Howard, Mary Elizabeth and Clement 
Hall. Morris Hall, the only son of Clement and Rebecca (Kay) Hall and 
a lineal descendant of William and Joane Braithwaite, of William and Sarah 
(Clement) Hall and of Ruthera and Jael (Baty) Morris, was born in 1787. 
In 1812 he married Elizabeth, a daughter of James Mason and Margaret 
(Carpenter) Woodnutt. She was born in 1790. Elizabeth (Woodnutt) 
Hall was fifth in the line of descent from Thomas Lloyd, deputy governor 
of Pennsylvania, and fourth in descent from Samuel Carpenter, both very 
eminent men in the Pennsylvania colony. Samuel Carpenter owned prop- 
erty in Elsinboro and other parts of western New Jersey. 

A large number of children were born to Morris and Elizabeth Hall, 
but only four reached years of maturity. Of these. Margaret Woodnutt 
Hall married John W. Righter; James Woodnutt Hall married first Mary 
Jarman and afterward Catherine Mulford, and died in 1897: Hannah Acton 
Hall, and Rebecca Kay never married. Elizabeth W. Hall died in 1832, 
and Morris Hall rented his farm in Mannington and removed with his two 
elder children to Beaver Meadows, in the center of the anthracite coal- 
mining district of Pennsylvania. From that time until his death, in 1839. 
he was the secretary and treasurer of the Beaver Meadows Coal Company. 
Morris Hall was very fond of books and read extensively, having an ex- 
cellent memory of what he read. He would often forget what was said to 
him. but seldom forgot what was in w'riting; and it was commonly said in 
his ofifice, "If you w^ant Mr. Hall to remember a thing you must let him see 
it in black and white;" so his employes were in the habit of leaving 
memoranda on his desk where he w'ould be sure to see them. 

The two younger children of the family remained with relatives in Salem, 
and they distinctly remember being taken to Beaver Meadows to \isit in 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 525 

early childhood, and the wonder and delight they experienced when they 
saw mountains for the first time. Their appreciation of the magnificent 
scenery around Mauch Chunk, so entirely dififerent from the flat and highly 
cultivated country about Salem, awakened their awe and delight in a greater 
degree than did the Alps and wonderful mountains and valleys of the Tyrol 
when seen in later years. The coal mines, too, were an unfailing source of 
interest. They considered it a great pleasure to be carried by a miner with 
a lamp in his cap as far back in the mines as it was possible to go and to see 
the tiny lamps moving about in all directions, twinkling like stars in the 
blackness of the mines. 

John Charles Righter, our subject, was born in Carbon county, Penn- 
sylvania, April II, 1855, and is the son of John Wilson and Margaretta 
(Hall) Righter. He first attended the private schools of Salem, entered 
Henry Ridgeway's boarding school at Bordentown, New Jersey, and then 
became a student in the Bloomsburg Normal School, of Pennsylvania. His 
first business venture was in the coal business at South Amboy, New 
Jersey, where he remained two years, and then accepted a position at the 
Salem Glass Works. Having determined to engage in business for him- 
self, he opened a men's furnishing house, which he conducted at a profit 
for three years, and then, thinking greater advantage could be derived from 
some other line, he closed out that stock and embarked in the hardware 
and wholesale oil business at the corner of Market and Grant streets. He 
also carries a line of agricultural implements and has other business interests. 

Mr. Righter was married April 21, 1897, to Miss Mary Caroline Burch, 
a daughter of Charles E. and Eva Anna (Reed) Burch. Her father was 
born in Pennsylvania and studied law. During the civil war he was made 
United States consul to Cardiff, Wales, and served through three adminis- 
trations. For some years he was connected with the state department of 
Washington, D. C, but is at present a resident of Philadelphia. He mar- 
ried Miss Reed, who died June 23, 1899. Mr. Burch is still living. Unto 
Mr. and Mrs. Righter have been born two sons : John Charles, whose birth 
occurred May 9, 1898; and Carroll Burch, born February 2, 1900. 

Mr. Righter is a Republican and is a prominent Mason, belonging to the 
blue lodge, chapter and commandery and to Lulu Temple of the Mystic 
Shrine. He is also a prominent Odd Fellow and a valued representative of 
the Knights of Pythias, Junior Order of United American Mechanics and 
the Ancient Order of United Workmen. He belongs to the Garfield Club 
and is a member of St. John's Episcopal church. It will thus be seen that 
he is actively and prominently connected with various social organizations

as well as with the business interests of Salem, and in all life's relations he. 
commands universal confidence and respect. 



JOHN HAMMOND COFFIN. 

The subject of this sketch was born in Hamnionton, Atlantic county, 
March i6, 1816, a son of William and Nancy (Bodine) Coffin. Worth's 
History of Devonshire. England, published in 1886, speaks of the Coffin 
family as having been seated at Postledge in the parish of Alwington. Oe\- 
onshire, almost from the time of the conquest: and mentions among its 
many men of note "Sir William Cof^n, master of the horse at the coronation 
of Anne Boleyn and a prominent participator in the Field of the Cloth of 
Gold. The founder of the family in America, Tristram Coffin, a native of 
Brixton, Devonshire. England, born about 1605, settled in Salisbury, Massa- 
chusetts, in 1643. He afterwards moved to Nantucket with one of his sons, 
purchasing one-seventh of that island, where very many of his posterity still 
reside. The family became connected by marriage with the W^inslow family, 
descendants of the Mayflower pilgrims, and through them with the Ham- 
mond family. 

Mr. Cofifin's grandfather came to New Jersey previous to the Revolu- 
tionary war. He settled in the vicinity of Green Bank, Burlington county, 
for the purpose of lumbering in the cedar swamps, and died there at a com- 
paratively early age. 

William Coffin, the father of John Hammond Coffin, was born in Green 
Bank, became a prominent business man and extensive landed proprietor, 
was the owner and first settler of the villages of Hammonton and W^inslow, 
Hammonton being named for his son, John Hammond, the subject of this 
sketch, and Winslow for his youngest son. Edward \\'inslow. He was 
largely interested in the manufacture of glass in each of these towns. He 
resided at Hammonton and died there in 1844, at the age of seventy years. 
His wife, Nancy Bodine, was born at Swage, Burlington county. Her 
ancestors were French Huguenots, and were early settlers in New Jersey. 
Her father, Joel Bodine, was a hotel keeper at Longacoming, now Berlin, 
and reared a family of five children. Mrs. Coffin died in 1864. at the age of 
eighty-four years. She was the mother of ten children, three of whom are 
now living: Bodine. John Hammond, and Edward Winslow. 

John Hammond was educated at the Academy at Haddonfield. and at 
an early age he became interested with his brother, Bodine, and at a later 
date with his brother, Edward Winslow, in the manufacture of glass at 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 527 

Hammonton. In 1847 '^^ purchased the interest of the latter and became 
sole proprietor of the property and business. Subsequently he sold the real 
estate to Charlotte Cushman. After disposing of his Hammonton property 
Mr. Cofifin moved to Philadelphia and engaged in the real estate business. 
Later he moved to Franklinville, Gloucester county, continuing in the 
same business. He has bought and sold many large tracts of land in South 
Jersey, and still in his advanced age is much interested in the business. 

In 1844 he was married to Elizabeth F. Dean, daughter of John Dean, 
of Philadelphia, who is said to have been closely connected with a member 
of the celebrated Boston tea party. Mrs. Coffin died in 1890. 



EUGENE Z. HILLEGASS, M.D. 

The Hillegass family is of German origin, but many generations have 
come and gone since it was founded in the New World, and representatives 
of the family were among the early colonists of Philadelphia and vicinity. 
During the yellow fever epidemic which prevailed there in 1826, Frederick 
Hillegass, becoming alarmed for his loved ones, gathered his household 
effects together and with a team started into the country. Going some dis- 
tance, he took up a large tract of wooded land, situated in what is now known 
as Upper Hanover township, Montgomery county. In the pioneer home 
which was founded in this wilderness, John Hillegass, the great-grandfather 
of the subject of this memoir, was born. Of necessity his vocation was agri- 
culture as he grew to manhood, but he was enterprisine, erecting a saw- 
mill upon his farm and building the first frame house in the vicinity, and later 
he built a hemp mill and a linseed-oil mill. The latter was the first mill of the 
kind ever put up in this county and it was continuously operated until 1897, 
having been reconstructed in the meantime. 

Peter, the son of John Hillegass and the grandfather of our subject, was 
born on a part of the original homestead taken up by his grandfather, and 
there he spent the major portion of his life. He, however, did not confine his 
attention to the tilling of the soil but became one of the most extensive deal- 
ers in live stock in that region. He also continued to operate the linseed-oil 
factory that had been established by his father, and, as a result of his excellent 
business enterprise, he accumulated a fortune. Several years prior to his 
death he retired and thenceforth gave his entire attention to looking after his 
large investments and business afTairs. His children were four in number: 
Dr. John G. ; Jacob, who died when young; Matilda, deceased, formerlv the 



528 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

wife of Dr. J. G. Mensch, of Pennsburg; and Maria, the wife of Dr. Henry 
Bobb, a physician and druggist of East Greenville, Pennsylvania. 

The birth of Dr. John G. Hillegass took place near Pennsburg, Upper 
Hanover township, Montgomery county, October 26, 1828. He received 
his elementary education at Washington Hall boarding school, at Trappe, 
Pennsylvania, being a student under Professor Rambo, at different times. 
Having a strong desire to become a physician, he entered the University of 
Pennsylvania, where he was graduated in the medical department in 1849. 
He then sought the experience which he wisely deemed necessary in his 
future labors, by practicing under competent physicians, in the city hospitals 
of Philadelphia. Establishing an office at Pennsburg, he then entered upon 
his life work in earnest, and for upward of two-score years commanded an ex- 
tremely large and remunerative practice. When his son, Dr. John P. Hille- 
gass, took his degree as Doctor of Medicine, the elder practitioner fully ex- 
pected to turn over the greater part of his practice to the younger, but his old 
patients refused to release him, and constantly importuned him to treat them, 
in illness, as he had done for so many 3'ears. After the death of his father, he 
succeeded to the old homestead and the linseed-oil mill, running the latter 
until 1878. In 1872 he became financially connected with his brother-in- 
law, Dr. Mensch, in a lumber-yard, flour, feed and coal business. He also 
built a large, handsome business block in Pennsburg, and was one of the 
projectors and organizers of the Perkiomen National Bank of East Green- 
ville, remaining as a director until his death. Politically, a Democrat of no 
uncertain stripe, he was the nominee of his party for the state senate upon 
one occasion, but was defeated by thirty-two votes. He was a life member 
of the New Goshenhoppen Reformed church, and was a charter member and 
the oldest past grand of Pennsburg Lodge, No. 449, I. O. O. F. He de- 
parted this life on the 5th of December, 1898, aged seventy-one years, one 
month and nine days. He was beloved and highly esteemed by all who knew 
him, and his worthy example has been and will be an influence for good upon 
the community in which he dwelt, for many years to come. 

On the 26th of October, 1852, Dr. J. G. Hillegass married Catherine A. 
Ziegler, a daughter of Jesse Ziegler, of Salford Station, Pennsylvania. She 
became the mother of ten children, all of whom she lived to behold occupying 
honored positions in the busy world. She preceded- her husband to the grave, 
her death taking place April 26, 1896, when she was three months and 
twenty-four days over sixty-two years of age. The children are named as fol- 
lows: Dr. Eugene Z.; Ida. the wife of Dr. John G. Hersch, of East Green- 
ville; Ella M., the wife of E. V. Hendricks, a leading business man of East 
Greenville, Pennsvlvania; Katie O., the wife of Dr. ^^^iIliam Hunsberger, of 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 529 

Pennsburg; Mary L.. the wife of Jacob B. Esser, the editor of the Kutztown 
Patriot, of Kutztown, Pennsylvania; Dr. John P., who was a very prominent 
and successful physician of Philadelphia, and whose death took place Feb- 
ruary 12, 1898, when he lacked but three weeks of celebrating his thirty-sec- 
ond anniversary; Dr. Jesse Z.. a graduate of the Ontario Veterinary College, 
of Ontario, Canada, and now a practitioner at Red Hill, Pennsylvania; 
Charles Q.. a graduate of the Philadelphia Dental College and now located 
in Pennsburg; Howard C, who, after being graduated in Franklin & 
Marshall College became assistant city editor of the New York Journal; and 
Calvin M., who has had charge of his father's investments for several years 
and is a promising young man. 

The birth of Dr. Eugene Z. Hillegass occurred on the old family estate in 
Upper Hanover township, Montgomery county, January 15, 1854, and, like 
his father, he received his preliminary education at Washington Hall Board- 
ing School, at Trappe, Pennsylvania. He engaged in teaching for a short 
time after completing his studies, and then, going to the Quaker city, he 
entered the College of Pharmacy, being graduated there February 11, 1874. 
His next step was to engage in the drug business at Seventh and Oxford 
streets, Philadelphia, in which he was successful. Subsequently he matricu- 
lated in Jefferson Medical College, and was graduated there in 1880, at once 
commencing to practice medicine, in connection with managing his drug 
store. In 1884 he sold out and removed to Aiken. South Carolina, where he 
conducted a drug business for one year. In 1885 he returned to the north, 
and since that time he has been the proprietor of a first-class pharmacy in 
Mantua, also engaged in the practice of medicine. As he justly deserves, he 
enjoys a large and remunerative business, and ranks among the leading 
physicians of this county. 

Fraternally, the Doctor is a member of the Legion Red Cross, Knights 
of Pythias, Order of Sparta and the Junior Order of United American Me- 
chanics. Politically he adheres to the doctrines of the Democratic party, 
while he is in no sense a seeker after public honors. He attends the Re- 
formed church, and endeavors to do all within his power to advance the 
cause of righteousness. 

The marriage of Dr. Hillegass and Amanda L. Reifsneider, a daughter of 
John P. Reifsneider, was solemnized in Philadelphia, in 1881. Their union 
is blessed with two sons and two daughters, namely: Harry S., Frank L., 
Florence and Helen. The family reside in a very pleasant, attractive home, 
where their numerous friends are frequently entertained in a most hospitable 
manner. 



530 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

JOHN C. WARD. 

John C. Ward, state factory inspector and a highly respected citizen of 
Salem county, New Jersey, is justly entitled to more than a passing notice in 
a volume of this character. He is a native of Camden county, born Septem- 
ber 9, 1853. His father, William H. Ward, was born in W^oodbury, New 
Jersey, which was the birthplace of his father, William T. Ward, whose 
father was Isaiah, born in the same county, and the son of James Ward, who 
came from England at an early date and bought a large tract of land. This 
tract is situated at and around what is now the present city of Woodbury, 
extending thence to what was then known as Red Bank, a historic place of 
Revolutionary times. It was held by the Ward family for a number of years, 
and was decreed by will to James Ward for life, at his death to go to his oldest 
male descendant. He (James), being of a patriotic spirit, sold his life-time 
right and gave the proceeds to congress during the trying times of the Revo- 
lution, and through the legal inactivity of his descendants the family became 
disseized of the property. He also contributed to the success of the Revolu- 
tion by purchasing a cannon and planting it on the shore of the Delaware 
river, and firing on a British vessel as it came up the river caused its maga- 
zine to explode. The hulk of the vessel is at present lying on the marsh on 
the Jersey side of the Delaware river just south of Gloucester. 

Our subject's father moved to Salem county about 1856. Previous to 
this time he had farmed in Camden county. He is spoken of as a man of up- 
right character, noted for his honor and honesty. The "Golden Rule" was 
his motto. He was one of the leading business men of Pittsgrove township, 
being engaged extensively in the shipping and produce business. Among 
various pieces of real estate owned by him may be mentioned a two-hundred- 
and-fifty-acre farm, in a high state of cultivation, situated at Palatine, on 
which he resided, and which is still held by the family. He died April 28, 
1881. His wife was Mary Ann Cook, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph 
Cook, of Monmouth county, New Jersey, and is still living. They were the 
parents of seven children. William T. is deceased, and six are still living, 
viz.: Joseph T., of Palatine; John C, our subject; James C, now the post- 
master of Palatine; Mary E., the wife of R. R. Miller, of Bridgeton; C. 
Howard, residing on the old homestead at Palatine; and Frank G., the junior 
member of the firm of J. C. Ward and Brother, now doing a general store 
business at Palatine, the firm being comprised of himself and the James C. 
Ward above mentioned. 

Our subject, John C. Ward, attended the public schools of Salem county, 
after which he attended a private school at Elmer, New Jersey. He assisted 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 531 

his father in business until the year 1876. when he went to Philadelphia and 
served on the police force at the Centennial Exposition. He was the sergeant 
of the force and remained throughout the great fair. The following year he 
returned to the employ of his father and purchased a farm. Among other 
property interests held by our subject may be mentioned a one hundred-and- 
eighty-five-acre tract of land, upon which he resides and carries on a general 
farming business at Centreton, New Jersey. ^Ir. Ward is a stanch supporter 
of the Republican party and has been elected to important oilfices by this 
organization. He is now a member of the Republican state committee. In 
1889 and 1890 he served in the state legislature, and in 1894-5-6 served in 
the state senate. At the end of the last term of his senatorship he was ap- 
pointed by the governor as the factory inspector for a term of five years. 

Of Mr. Ward's domestic relations let it be said that in 1877 he was mar- 
ried to Lizzie Allen, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles z\llen, of this section 
of the state. Two children bless their union: Roscoe Conkling, a law stu- 
dent at Bridgeton; and C. Harry, at home. 

He of whom we write is a man possessing a fine physique and is admired 
by a large company of followers who prize him for his many manly deeds and 
his genial deportment as a citizen and office-holder. To be favored by an 
appointment by Governor Griggs to so important a place in the conimon- 
uealth, indeed, speaks enough for his public standing in New Jersey. He 
belongs to the Masonic fraternity, being one of the trustees of this great 
order, and he also belongs to the order of American Red Men, in which he is 
prominent. 



THE OGDEN FAMILY 



The first American ancestor of this family, David Ogden, was born in 
England February i, 1655, came to America with Penn in 1682, located in 
Philadelphia, and later settled in Delaware county, Pennsylvania. He mar- 
ried Martha, a daughter of John Houlston, by whom he had children named 
Jonathan, Matthias, Sarah, Nehemiah, Samuel, John, Aaron, Hannah and 
Stephen. The fifth child, Samuel, born October 30. 1695, died November 
II, 1747, married Ester Lownes and died, leaving the following named chil- 
dren: David, Jane, Mary, Groworth. Jonathan, Howard, Sarah, James, John 
and Samuel. Of these Samuel, born in Delaware county, Pennsylvania, May 
8, 1745, and died April 21, 1821. came to New Jersey as a journeyman tan- 
ner and about 1767 ran a tannery where the Ogden farm now is. He mar- 
ried Mary Ann, a daughter of John Hoffman, by whom he had ten children: 
Marv. Esther, Joseph, Martha, Hannah, Ann, Sarah, Samuel, John and 



532 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

David. Joseph Ogden. the third child and first son, born on the farm August 
4, 1775, and died December 20, 1863. married Sybyl Tatum and had as chil- 
dren David, Samuel, Elizabeth. John, Mary and Ann. The oldest child, David, 
born February 3, 1802, received a good education, learned mining and fol- 
lowed it until 1 84 1, and then settled upon a farm, was a successful man of 
affairs, a Whig in poHtics, commanded a wide influence and represented his 
county in the legislature for two years. He married Beulah P., a daughter 
of Samuel Hancock, and their children were Anna, Clarkson and Beulah. 

Clarkson Ogden, the son of David Ogden and Beulah Hancock, was born 
June 14, 1825, educated in the public schools, the Friends' schools, at West 
Town Boarding School, and at a private school in Wilmington. At twenty- 
two years of age he was for a brief time in the sash-and-blind business, later 
he dealt in coal and wood, up to 1857, then settled upon the home farm and 
lias since taken an active interest in politics. 

In February, 1851, he was married to Lydia, a daughter of Charles Rich- 
ards, of Wilmington, Delaware. Mrs. Ogden, by whom he had no children,

1898, to Ella F.. a daughter of Edward Webb, of New Castle county, Dela- 
ware. 



CAMDEN. 



In preparing the history of Camden the writer has copied freely from a 
pamphlet called "Some Account of Camden's Rise and Growth," by How- 
ard ^I. Cooper, and herewith gratefully acknowledges his indebtedness to 
Mr. Cooper for the information gleaned from his work. In the article men- 
tioned Mr. Cooper says: 

"Sailing up this broad river [the Delaware] in 163 1, noting the creeks 
and estuaries emptying into it. the Dutch commander, De Vries, discovered, 
about one hundred miles from its mouth, on the eastern shore, a large, 
thickly wooded island, which he called Jacques Eylandt. The Swedes, com- 
ino- seme seven or eight years after, observing the same isle, with much 
better taste called it by its Indian name, Aquikanasra. Though they ex- 
plored, neither the Dutch nor the Swedes settled here, where the Maeroah- 
kong tribe of the Delaware Indians lived. Until the persecution in England 
drove the Friends tOiWest Jersey for asylum, these Indians, under Arasapha, 
their kino-, with their village at Cooper's Point, were the only inhabitants 
within our limits. 

"Who first of the English emigrants made the future Camden his home 
is uncertain, but it was probably Richard Arnold or William Cooper. Few

traces remain of Richard Arnold, who seems to have left no descendants in 
these parts. \Mlliam Cooper, the ancestor of many families that still cluster 
about his choice of a home, came from England in 1679 and stopped for 
about a year at Burlington before he chose his permanent residence. Pass- 
in- up and down the Delaware, the bold bluff, heavily wooded with pme tun- 
be^'r at the point where the river, sharply curving, receives the stream called 
by the Swedes the Hiorte-Kilen, or Deer Creek, from the many deer seen 
along its banks, and along which grew peach trees and the sweet-smellmg 
sassafras tree, striking his fancy, he fixed upon it as his iuture abode and 
called it 'Pyne Povnte.' His name, however, soon attached itself perma- 
nently to both point and creek. He located at Cooper's Point in the spring 
of 1681, building his house well out on the river's edge, just below the 
mouth of the creek, a site long years ago washed awa> by the encroaching 

tide. 

"Recognizing the brotherhood of the Indians and their right to the soil 
that they and their fathers hunted over and possessed undisputed, the com- 
missioners sent over by the proprietors of West Jersey bought of them 
their right from Oldham's creek to Assunpink, securing their title by three 
deeds, the eariiest of which, dated Sei>tember 10, 1677. covered Camden's 
territory and extended from Timber to Rancocas creek, William Cooper, 
further to satisfv the tribe at Cooper's Point, paid them for the right they 
still claimed and received from them a deed executed by Tallacca, their chief, 
and witnessed by several of their tribe. Returning the red man's trust and 
friendliness with honesty and fair dealing, Camden's eariy settlers tound 
them always friends, and' no tale of Indian massacre blots our history. 

"The Friends had no sooner effected a settlement than they met for 
worship. The following appears in 'this minute of the monthly meeting held 
at Thomas Gardiner's house. Burlington, seventh month (Septemlier) 5. 
1681 : Ordered, that Friends of Pyne Poynte have a meeting on every 
fourth-dav. and to begin at the second hour, at Richard Arnold's house.' 
It was the onlv -meeting' between Salem and Buriington. and the third in 
priority in West Jersey, and has been kept up by Friends without a lapse 
from that time to the present. Shortly afterward the meeting was held at 
Pyne Poynte. at the house of William Cooper, a minister, and continued 
there until the arrival of the 'Irish Friends.' who settled at Newton in the 
spring of 1682. But as the Newton Friends were much more numerous 
than die few scattered families about the Poynte it was more convenient 
to most of the members for the place of worship to be located at their settle- 
ment; and in 16S4 the first building devoted to religious meetings in 
Gloucester county was built on the middle branch of Newton creek, at what 



534 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

is now West Collingswood Station, on the Reading Railroad to Atlantic 
City. 

"B\- 1686 quite a number of emigrants had arrived in this part of West 
Jersey and settled about Red Bank, Woodbury, Arwames or Gloucester, 
Newton and the Po_\nte. and felt strongly the inconvenience of having to 
go all the way to Salem or Burlington to transact their public business. 
Accordingly, on the 26th of May, 1686, the proprietors, freeholders and in- 
habitants of the Third and Fourth Tenths, that is, the territory between 
Pensauken and Oldman's creek, acting in the spirit of pure democracy, met 
at Arwanes and formed that quaintly curious form of county government, 
having only ten short paragraphs, that is still preserved in the original book 
of minutes, in the clerk's office of Gloucester county, at Woodbury. This 
was the origin of old Gloucester, the only county in New Jersey that can 
deduce its existence from a direct and positive compact between her in- 
habitants. 

"The action of the people in thus forming their county organization, 
without any authority of the legislature, was, after having been indirectly 
recognized in one or two other laws directly sanctioned in 1694, by an act 
of the legislature, establishing the boundaries that they had themselves 
chosen, and adopting their title of the county of Gloucester. 

"The necessity of a regular ferry to Philadelphia being very soon felt by 
the new settlers, they applied to their new court at Gloucester to license 
one, which, on the first day of third month (March), 1687, it did, as appears 
by this minute : it is proposed to ye Bench y-t a iYerry is very needfull and 
much wanted from Jersey to Philadelphia, and y-t William Roydon's house 
is look-t upon as a place convenient, and the said William Roydon, a person 
suitable for that implo}-. and therefore an order desired from ye Bench that 
a fferry may by there fixed, etc., to which ye Bench assents and refer to ye 
grand jury to methodize ye same and fix ye rates thereof.' This they pro- 
ceeded to do in a very leisurely manner, for not until one year afterward, on 
the first day of the first month, 1688, did they issue their license to William 
Roydon and his assigns. It was located near the foot of Cooper street, its 
boats being only open flat-boats propelled by oars or sails. A few years 
afterward it was purchased by \\'illiam Cooper, and for more than one 
hundretl years thereafter Camden was everywhere known as Cooper's 
Ferries. 

"The establishment of the county supplied only a part of the necessary 
political machinery, and so on the first day of June, 1695, the grand jury, 
with the assent of the bench, and in accordance with an act of the then last 
assembly, constituted the constablewick or township of Newton to extend 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 535 

from "the lowermost branch of Cooper's creek to ye southerly branch of 
Newton creek bounding Gloucester,' but fixing no bounds on the east. 
With their local government thus completed, the people in these parts re- 
mained content for one hundred and thirty-three years. Thus was created 
old Newton township, which, after having its fairest portion cut off in the 
creation of Haddon township, was finally, after a life of one hundred and 
seventy-six years, swallowed up by its own progeny and obliterated from 
the map in 1871, when Camden's revised charter was obtained. 

"At the opening of the eighteenth century the smoke curling from less 
than a dozen clearings by the water's edge pointed out the forerunners more 
than two centuries ago of our present expanding town. However, in 1773, 
Jacob Cooper, a merchant living in Philadelphia, and a lineal descendant 
of the first William Cooper, foreseeing the future town, employed Thomp- 
son, a Philadelphia surveyor, to lay out forty acres into a town plat. A 
Whig, sympathizing with his fellow Whigs in their stniggle to obtain from 
their mother country that representation which they claimed should ever 
accompany taxation, and venerating those Englishmen who, believing in 
the justness of this demand of the colonies, had the courage to openly 
avow their belief. Jacob Cooper named his new town Camden, in honor of 
that powerful champion of constitutional liberty and firm advocate of fair 
dealing with the colonies, who has been called the right arm of Lord 
Chath.am, Charles Pratt, first earl of Camden. In the infant town thus 
christened only six streets ran north and south, — King, Queen, Whitehall, 
Cherry, Cedar and Pine, intersected at right angles at the Delaware side by 
Cooper and Market streets only, but on the eastern side by Plum also. 

"Almost immediately after Camden was planned the Revolution broke 
out. During the whole of the occupation of Philadelphia by the British, 
Cooper's Point was held by them as an outpost. Lying directly opposite 
Philadelphia, Camden's territory was constantly overrun and its farming 
population harassed and alarmed by detached parties of British soldiers 
skirmishing and foraging, taking what they wished. Although Camden is 
not distinguished as one of the battle-fields of the Revolution, yet the ground 
on which the non-resisting followers of Fox have placed their humble meet- 
ing-house was twice the scene of warlike manoeuvers. For many years after 
the Revolution Camden was a town only in name, and that only on paper, 
being called Cooper's Ferries, or simply The Ferries, until after the be- 
ginning of this century. A few sales of lots had been made and a few 
houses begun to cluster about the ferries and a road or two more had been 
opened, but all else was farm or wood land. \Mien this centun,- opened not 
a house of worship stood within the present limits of Camden. In 1801, 



536 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

however, the Friends, having decided to move their place of meeting from 
their old house on Newton creek to a more central locality, built the bricl-; 
meeting-house that stands at the corner of Mount Ephraim avenue ami 
Mount Vernon street, the forerunner of Camden's present sixty-five or 
seventy churches; and next, in 1810, the Methodists dedicated their first 
church at the northwest corner of Fourth and Federal streets, long smce 
converted into stores, followed, in 1818, by the First Baptist church, on 
Fourth street; and thereafter the churches kept pace with Camden's growth. 

"The mode of ferriage across the Delaware in open boats, established as 
we have seen so early in our history, remained without change or improve- 
ment until 1809 or 1810, when a small steamboat, carrying passengers only, 
was placed on the river. She was named the Camden and ran from the foot 
of Cooper street to the lower side of Market street, Philadelphia. In 1809 
the ferry at Kaighn's Point was established, and soon a small steamboat, a'so 
carrying passengers only, and also, it is believed, called the Camden, was 
placed on the line. Which of the two was the first steamboat is doubtful. 
It was not until 1835 that the steam ferry boat, regularly making its trips 
winter and summer alike, became firmly established as a tixtme on the 
Delaware highway. 

"Though Camden's early growth was very small, and half a century 
after its birth it was but a small town, yet it had a vigor of self-assertion 
that compelled its recognition by the people of the country. The annual 
town meetings of Newton township had been held alternately here and at 
Haddonfield until 1827, when the Haddonfielcl people, conscious of their 
greater voting strength, at the town meeting, held regularly in turn at tJieir 
place, resolved to shove Camden to the wall and thereafter to meet only at 
Haddonfield. Their superior number carried the question. But he laughs 
best who laughs last, and they unconsciously aroused the young giant that 
ever afterward whipped them in many a hard-fought battle. The Camden- 
ians left the town meeting very indignant, and Jeremiah Sloan, then a tal- 
ented young lawyer of great promise, said to the Hacldonfielders, 'I'll fix 
you: I will have Camden incorporated next winter." He executed this 
threat, and at the next session of the legislature the act was passed incor- 
porating the city of Camden. Thus it was that Camden, with a population 
of but one thousand one hundred and forty-three, attained her legal ma- 
jority with the right to manage her own affairs as she saw fit, free from 
the tutelage of country town meetings. 

"The first charter was passed February 14, 1828, and is entitled 'An act 
to incorporate a part of the township of Newton, in the county of Glouces- 
ter.' It has only eighteen sections, and. though but seventy-one years have 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 537 

passed, many of its provisions already sound quaint. At the first election 
for city officers, held March 10, 1828, the following common-councilmen 
were chosen: James Duer, from Cooper's Ferry; John Lawrence, Ebenezer 
Toole and Richard Fetters, from Camden; and Joseph Kaighn, from Kaighn- 
ton. James Duer and Joseph Kaighn declining to serve, at a special elec- 
tion, held on the 5th of the following April, Edward Dougherty and Richard 
B. Champion were chosen in their place. The new council held its first 
meeting on March 13. 1828, and elected Samuel Lanning, the first mayor 
of Camden. The new municipality, hcwex'er, had ])ut little of the appearance 
of a city. The three villages of which it was composed — Camden proper. 
Cooper's Point and Kaighn's Point — remained separated l)y cultivated farnis 
and retained their peculiar characteristics for many years. 

"About this time the desire for a more speedy conveyance than the old 
stage coach was cropping out in many places throughout the country, and 
very general inquiry was being made into the feasibility of railroads to meet 
the want. During 1827 the project of a railway to connect Philadelphia 
and New York began to be talked of in earnest. Meetings were held in the 
Camden Academy of those favoring the enterprise, preliminary surveys made 
and such general interest excited as finally resulted in the legislature grant- 
ing, on February 4, 1830, the charter for the Camden & Amboy Railroad 
and Transportation Company. The company was soon organized and the 
road begun, and in 1834 the first train ran into Camden. This was a very 
marked event for the young city. The railroad was the longest then built in 
this country anrl its completion a matter of great rejoicing. 

"Camden, not satisfied with being a city, now began to think that there 
should be a new county created with it as the shire-town, and actively pushed 
the project. This excited great opposition throughout the county. Indig- 
nation meetings were held at Woodbury and other places. The Camden 
people had to fight almost unaided their uphill battle. They claimed it as a 
necessary measure 'to accommodate the fast-swelling population of the north 
and northwestern townships, and partly to secure to West Jersey her just 
share of influence in the state government.' At last, after a hard fight under 
the lead of Captain John W. Mickle, an uncompromising Democrat, they 
won and got the legislature, which was Democratic, to pass, on March 13. 
1844, under the plea that the new county would be Democratic, the act 
setting it off from old Gloucester and had it named after their own city, 
which was to be the seat of justice for one year and until an election could 
be had. But the people throughout the country were so incensed at the 
city's again foiling them that at the first election they voted, irrespective of 
party, against the Democratic nominees, recognizing no other issue than 



538 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Camden and anti-Camden, and for fifteen years the Democrats never carried 
tlie county. The same antagonism cropped out at the permanent fixing of 
the county seat. Camden, of course, nominated herself; and all the rest of 
the county, boiling over in rage at the very idea, nominated Long-A- 
Coming and carried the election. But the Camden people would not stay 
down, and in 1848 had a law passed directing a new election. The second 
fight was doubly bitter. It was again the whole of the county against the 
city, but Camden had well encased herself in armor against the shafts of her 
opponents in her tmaided tilt against the field, and came out victorious by a 
large majority. 

"In 1850 Camden obtained a new charter with enlarged powers, but no 
increase of territory, and began to grow with considerable energy, until the 
horrible burning of the ferryboat New Jersey, on the night of March 15, 
1856, with its holocaust of sixty-one lives, at once checked migrations from 
Philadelphia, while the panic of 1857, following, completed the blow to its 
prosperity. Then the doubt and uncertainty of the impending rebellion and 
I he exhaustion of the struggle when entered upon protracted the stagnation 
and our city lay in a torpor until late after the collapse of the war, the pros- 
perous times thawed it into new life, that, bursting the chrysalis of the 
boundaries of its original incorporation of 1828, reached out and grasped, 
under its revised charter in 1871, new territory, increasing its size threefold; 
and in the same year, when the Camden Horse Railroad Company started 
its passenger cars, came what all had been hoping for, pitblic conveyances 
enabling every one to ride from one end of the city to the other, so evidently 
supplying a public want that the West Jersey Press was enabled thus ex- 
ultantly to describe the opening of the lines to public travel : 'Federal street 
had a huge load of excitement to stagger under on Saturday last, and ihe 
street was crowded with spectators from early morn to dewy eve, while the 
curbstone corners in particular were the resorts of shouting boys and won- 
dering men. A long wished-for event came to pass, and a new era in the 
growth of the city's conveniences was successfully inaugurated. In a word, 
the new horse cars began to run. Let us mark the date. November 25, 1871. 
Such occurrences as these are mileposts in the history of our city's progress 
and should be recorded as worthy of special eclat.' 

"Such-, then, brokenly told, is Camden's story of the past. To-day, 
arousing from the stagnation following the panic of 1893, our town does not 
have to seek new territory, but has only to receive that tendered to it by its 
neighbors, conscious that under its protecting segis their prosperity and 
happiness will be enhanced; and, enlarged in boundary one-third and in 
population one-sixth, under the act of March 24, 1899. annexing, at the

request of its inhabitants, the town of Stockton, Camden, covering now a 
territory of some twelve square miles with a population of seventy-five thou- 
sand, the metropolis of West Jersey, following the law of growth of all live 
municipalities, moves on to its greater, and with its improved streets, its fine 
water, its parks, libraries, and higli school, to its higher development." 



SEDGWICK R. LEAP. 



The family of which Sedgwick R. and David D. Leap, of Penn Grove, are 
worthy representatives, is of German extraction, and many of the sterling 
qualities of tliat sturdy, independent, self-respecting race have been inherited 
by these brothers. They and their father before them have been identified 
with mercantile pursuits for many decades, and have borne a reputation for 
integrity and business honor which greatly redounds to their credit. 

John P. Leap, the father, was a blacksmith by trade, and followed that 
calling at Sculltown (now known as Auburn) until about 1840. He then 
established a general merchandising business there and carried it on success- 
fullv for some eight years. Believing that better opportunities for progress 
were to be found in Penn Gro\e. he removed his store hither, and in 1848, 
having placed his affairs on a good basis, he retired in favor of his sons, 
Sedgwick R. and David D., who had assisted him since their boyhood and 
were now fully competent to manage the business. He lived a few years 
longer and was in his sixtieth year at the time of his death, in 1859. His 
widow, whose maiden name was Eunice Dennis, survived him a quarter of 
a century, and was eighty-three years old when summoned to the better land. 
Of their children four are yet living, namely: Sarah, the widow of John ]\L 
Biddle; Sedgwick R.. David D. and Charles, the latter a farmer of Upper 
Penn"s Neck township. James, John P., George and Henrietta are deceased. 

Sedgwick R. Leap was born in the town of Auburn, Salem county, in 
1830, and, as stated previously, he early commenced working in his father's 
store, which at first was a very small one. barely twelve by sixteen feet in 
dimensions. Later, from 1858 to 1888, a story-and-a-half cottage served the 
firm as a store, but in the year last mentioned a commodious structure, 
seventy by seventy feet in dimensions, with a residence attached, was built. 
This afforded ample accommodations for a large and well selected stock of 
goods, such as is always kept by the enterprising proprietors. Li 1885 John 
P.. our subject's only son, was taken into partnership witli him, and they are 
prospering even beyond their expectations. 

In the social as well as in the commercial workl, Mr. Leap has established 



540 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

a desirable reputation, and in the Odd Fellows. Masonic and Knights of 
Pythias orders he is a highly esteemed member. He also belongs to the 
Methodist Episcopal church. He married Mary P. Framljes. a daughter of 
Job and Hannah (Somers) Frambes, in 1857. Her parents passed their 
entire lives in Atlantic county, New Jersey. A son and a daughter were 
born to Mr. and Mrs. Leap, but the daughter, Laura E., has 1)een called to 
the better land. 

David D. Leap, a brother of Seilgwick R. Leap, and for a number of 
years his business partner, is now conducting a clothing and men's furnishing 
store in a fine building opposite our subject's location. He was a clerk for 
some time in the store of David Guest, and at the death of his father liecame 
the partner of Sedgwick R. Leap, which connection, under the firm name of 
S. R. Leap & Brother, continued in existence until 1886. He was one of the 
prime movers in having Penn Grove incorporated as a borough, and in all 
local afifairs he takes a leading part. He was married, in 1872, to Adeline S. 
Smith, a daughter of John Smith, of Pittsgrove township, and four children 
have been born to them, namely: Wilber, Rena B., Jennie and Alonie, the 
latter deceased. 



S. R. BUDD. 



One of the most successful business men of Woodbury. New Jersey, is 
the gentleman whose name heads this sketch. He is here engaged in the 
livery business, and also conducts an undertaking establishment. His enter- 
prise and diligence have brought to him prosperity, and he is accounted one 
of the valued citizens of Gloucester county. 

Mr. Budd was born in Burlington county, New Jersey. April 26, 185 1, 
and his father, Thomas Budd, was a native of the same place. The grand- 
father, Samuel Budd. was a minister of the Methodist church, and was 
of English descent, the family having been founded in America at an early 
day. Thomas Budd was a stock dealer and drover, and made very extensive 
shipments. He owned a farm of one hundred acres, near Pemberton. and 
was also the proprietor of a stage line from Pemberton to Mount Ho'.ly. 
In all his undertakings he was remarkably successful: but his prosperity 
could not be attributed to chance — it came as the result of close application, 
and the exercise of correct business principles, and in conseciuence was well 
merited. 

Mr. Budd was united in marriage to Amanda, daughter of Solomon 
Middleton, who was one of the extensive dealers in horses in Pemberton, 
this state. Unto Mr. and Mrs. Budd were born seven children. fi\-e of 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 541 

whom are now living: Annie, wife of Byron Grill, of Vincenttown. New 
Jersey; S. R., of this review; Mary, the wife of Frank Butterworth, of 
Trenton; Thomas E.. of South Orange, and Lillie, wife of Frank Carr, of 
Woodbury. The father of these children resided in Pemberton and was a 
very prominent member of the Baptist church, taking an active part in its 
work and serving as a member of the synod. He died in 1869, but his 
wife is still living, at the age of seventy-three years. 

S. R. Budd was reared upon the old home farm, and is indebted to the 
common schools of the neighborhood for the education he received. He 
entered business life as a butcher and followed that business in his native 
county for five years. In 1875 he engaged in the livery business in Cam- 
den, and in 1882 he came to Woodbury, where he opened a butcher's shop. 
In 1887 he purchased the Newton Hotel stables, and also leased another 
livery stable: both of them he has since conducted and both are excellently 
equipped with a fine line of carriages. He does the largest business in 
his line in the town, and his courtesy to his patrons, his reliability, and his 
enterprise assure him continued success. In 1894 he also extended the 
field of his labors by engaging in the undertaking business, and has found 
this a profitable source of income. 

In 1875 Mr. Budd married Miss Annie Carlin, and they had three chil- 
dren : Rena, Edna and Mary. Mr. Budd belongs to the Red Cross society 
and the Knights of Pythias fraternity. During the years of his residence 
in Woodbury he has won the high regard of all with whom he came in 
contact by liis honorable business methods, his fidelity to all the duties 
of life and his loyalty as a citizen. Through his own well-directed efiforts 
he has acquired a handsome competency, and his success illustrates what 
can be accomplished through determined purpose and a laudable ambition. 



THE WOODBURY DAILY TIMES. 

The Woodbury Daily Times was established on the 2d of February, 
1892, by its present proprietors, C. Walter Hawn and J. Frank Wilson. 
The paper has been managed as an independent journal, and has been 
an earnest adA-ocate of all local measures and movements for the public 
benefit. It has a very large circulation in the county and state, and the 
firm own a splendidly equipped plant, located on Cooper street. Gas 
power is used in the operation of the machinery, and the oiifice is well 
equipped with all modern conveniences and accessories for carrying on the 
business. The Times is one of the leading papers in the county. It is 



542 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

published as a four-page daily, except on Saturdays, when it is an eight- 
page paper. It is the only daily in Gloucester county, and is indeed credit- 
able'to the proprietors and to the district through which it is distributed. 
The owners are men of good business ability and their advocacy of public 
measures has been an influential factor in support of many interests. 



CHARLES WALTER HAWN. 

Charles Walter Hawn, one of the proprietors and publishers of the 
Woodbury Daily Times, was born at Millville, New Jersey, on the I3tli of 
July, 1871, his parents being Charles and Rachel Hawn. The family is of 
German lineage, and was established in southern New Jersey at a ven*' 
early day. The grandfather, Moses Hawn, resided in Salem county, near 
Alloway, where he followed the blacksmith's trade, and probably ■ spent 
his last days. He reared a large family, including Charles Hawn, who also 
became a blacksmith and followed that pursuit throughout the years of 
his active business life. He was long employed in the line of his chosen 
vocation by the firm of Whitall, Tatum & Company, of Millville. He 
married Rachel Green. The parents of our subject had nine children, 
namely: Isaiah C, John K., David, Bessie, C. Walter, Eva C. William C. 
and two who died in childhood. 

During his youth Mr. Hawn, of this review, resided in Cumberland, 
Salem and Gloucester counties, and obtained his education in the public 
schools near his home. At the age of fifteen years he had to put aside his 
text-books in order to earn his own living. He worked on the farm during 
the spring, summer and fall months, and pursued his education through 
the winter season. In 1887 he began learning the printer's trade at Elmer, 
New Jersey, which he has since followed. He mastered the business in the 
composing room, and now has a practical knowledge of all departments 
of the work both as a compositor and editor. In 1897 he established the 
Woodbury Daily Times with J. Frank Wilson as a partner in the business. 
They have made this one of the leading papers in southern New Jersey, and 
are now enjoying a large and lucrative patronage. 

Mr. Hawn was married at Elmer, New Jersey, on the 15th of September, 
1892, to Miss Mattie Elizabeth Wilson, and unto them have been born 
three children: Esther May, September 21, 1894; Charles Elmer, April 4, 
1896, and Helen Claire, June 16, 1900. 

Mr. and Mrs. Hawn are prominent members and active workers in 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 543 

the Keinble Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Hawn is also active in the 
Epworth League, and has been secretary and president of the chapter. 
On the 2d of February, 1892, he became a member of Woodbury Castle, 
No. 15, Knights of the Golden Eagle, and is now serving as its treasurer. 
In pohtics he is a Republican with prohibition tendencies. His military 
experience covers five years' service with Company E, of the Sixth Regi- 
ment of the New Jersey National Guard, which he joined in May, 1890. 
As a citizen he is public-spirited and progressive and withholds his support 
from no movement or measure which is calculated to prove of public benefit 
along social, material, educational and moral lines. Through the columns 
of his paper and by personal efifort he does what he can to advance public 
good, and his worth as a man and citizen is widely acknowledged. 



J. HILDRETH FOGG. 



The Fogg family is one of the oldest in Salem county. New Jersey. 
Charles Fogg, the great-great-grandfather of J. Hildreth Fogg, settled 
on the farm in Lower Alloway Creek township now occupied by the latter, 
in 1753, and it has since been occupied by the family. J. Hildreth Fogg was 
born on that farm May 30, 1844, and is a son of Joseph H. Fogg and Rachel, 
nee Allen. His father was a son of David Fogg, who was a native of Green- 
wich, Cumberland county. New Jersey, and came to Lower Alloway Creek 
township soon after 1840, and died there in 1888, at the age of seventy-one 
years. He was a man well known in the county, served as county treasurer 
for a number of years, and was one of the most active Republicans in his 
township, unwavering in his support of the principles of his party. The 
family consisted of five children: J. Hildreth; Hannah, now Mrs. Oliver 
Smith, of Salem; Isaac, a farmer in Mannington township; Rachel, now Mrs. 
Charles Zelley, of Salem, and Aaron, a farmer in Mannington township. 

Mr. Fogg was educated in the public schools of Salem county, and at 
Mount Holly, New Jersey. Upon leaving school he returned to the farm 
and has followed farming all his life, becoming the owner of the old home- 
stead upon his father's death. He is a successful farmer, an extensive 
grower of tomatoes — the staple product of southern New Jersey — and has 
his own cannery for preparing them for the market. 

Mr. Fogg was married March 20, 1877, to Elizabeth, a daughter of 
Jesse Patrick, of Lower Alloway Creek, by whom he has five children^ — 
Arthur L., Frank G., Hildreth Ross, Bessie L. and William.

J. FR.\XK \\TLSOX. 

Well known in ioumahstic circles as one of the proprietors and editors 
of the Woodbur\- Daily Times. Mr. Wilson is accounted one of the leading 
and influential citizens of southern Xew Jersey. He is numbered among the 
native sons of the state, his birth ha\-ing occurred in Franklinville. Glou- 
cester coimty, on the 2d of Xovember. 1856. For many years his ancestors 
had hved in that section of the state, the family having originallv been

founded in America by German emigrants who sought homes in the New 
World. The parents of our subject were Eh and Sarah (Andrews) Wilson. 
The paternal grandfather, Eli Wilson, resided in Franklinville, and was a 
manufacturer of brick. He died about 1868. In his family were six chil- 
dren, namely : Joseph, Eli, Rebecca, Elizabeth, Martha and Rachel. Most 
of his family reside in Philadelphia, but Rachel and Elizabeth are now 
deceased. The grandmother, Rachel (Clare) Andrews was of English de- 
scent and died in 1894. Her ancestors came to the New World from 
England, and her father, Robert Clare, fought with the American army 
in the war of the Revolution, valiantly aiding in the struggle for independ- 
ence. He was one of the earliest settlers in Franklin township, Gloucester 
county. 

Eli Wilson, the father of our subject, made farming his life work, and 
was actively identified with agricultural pursuits for many years, but is 
now living retired in Woodbury, enjoying a rest which he has truly earned 
and richly deserves. At the time of the civil war he loyally responded to 
the call for troops and joined Company I, Twentj'-fourth Regiment of New 
Jersey Volunteers, serving for nine months. He was wounded in the battle 
of Fredericksburg. 

He married Sarah Andrews, and they became the parents of nine children, 
namely: Lewis, who died in childhood; Thomas H., who is living at Mill 
Hall, Pennsylvania; Elmer E., who died at the age of eighteen years; J. 
Frank; Perry B., who is married and follows farming at Elmer, New Jersey; 
Emma R., wife of David Hewes, of Woodbury, New Jersey; Mattie E., 
wife of C. Walter Hawn, of Woodbury; Albert S., who' is engaged in the 
bicycle business in Woodbury, and Howell A., a window-glass worker of 
Millville, New Jersey. 

J. Frank W'ilson pursued his education in the public schools of Franklin- 
ville, and entered upon his business career as an employe in the printing- 
department of the patent-medicine works of G. G. Green, at Woodbury. 
He remained for some time in that employ, and afterw-ard assisted in the 
establishment of the Daily Times, a paper with which he has since been 
connected and now recognized as one of the leading journals in southern 
New Jersey. 

r^Ir. Wilson wedded ^liss Alary E. Dail. of A\'oodbury, a daughter of 
Jeremiah Dale, and they have five children: Ethel M., now the wife of 
W. E. Keat. of Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania; Harry E.. J. Frank, Robert H. 
and Howard W. With the exception of the daughter, the children are all 
vet at their parental home. Mr. AMlson and his family attend the Methodist 
Episcopal church, of which he is a member and has been a trustee for

fifteen years. In politics he is a stalwart Republican, taking a deep and 
earnest interest in the work of the party locally. His advancement in the 
business world is due entirely to his own efforts, his close application, his 
sturdy perseverance and his sound judgment. He is recognized as one 
of the most energetic and most enterprising men of Woodbury, and is 
in every way a splendid type of our best American citizenship. 



HENRY ALLEN. 



For more than thirty-five years Henry Allen was numbered among the 
leading representatives of the agricultural interests of Gloucester county, 
and by the exercise of his business ability, by unflagging industry and care- 
ful management he secured a handsome competence which classed him 
among the wealthy citizens of this community. His many excellencies of 
character also gained for him the high regard of his friends and all who 
knew him mourned his death. 

Henry Allen was born in Salem county. New Jersey, on the nth of 
August, 1820, and was a son of Henry and Ann (Rogers) Allen. The 
former was born July 19, 1789, and died December 27, 1870, while the 
latter was born August 24, 1790, and died February 21, 1868. They were 
married on the 21st of January, 1813, and became the parents of six chil- 
dren: Michael, the eldest, was born November 12, 1813, and resided in 
Lexington, Missouri, but died February 6, 1873, while on a business trip 
in the east; Margaret, born February 25, 181 6, became the wife of Charles 
Engle, of Camden, New Jersey, and died December 5, 1868; Maria, born 
May 27, 1818, became the wife of James Thompson, their home being 
between Auburn and Sharptown, and her death occurred March 14, 1884; 
Henry was the next of the family; Joseph R., born October 29, 1822, died 
near Woodstown, New Jersey, and Jehu, born April 18, 1825, died in 
Woodstown. 

Henry Allen, whose name introduces this record, remained in Salem 
county until about 1840, when he removed to Gibbstown, Gloucester 
county. He was married on the 24th of February, 1842, to Miss Catherine 
Fish, a daughter of Isaac Fish, of Repaupo, New Jersey. Her death 
occurred February 8, 1869, at the age of forty-four years. Eight children 
were born of their union, namely: Ann, deceased wife of Edward G. Green, 
of Gibbstown, New Jersey; Maria F., the wife of Samuel Salisbury, of 
Swedesboro; Isaac, a farmer of Paulsboro; Joseph, who died at the age 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEIF JERSEY. 547 

of three years; Eli, who died in Gibbstown, at the age of forty-five years; 
Margaret, the wife of Amos G. Hurf, of Swedesboro; Veronica, the wife 
of Benjamin Weatherby, of Millville, Xew Jersey, and Kate, the wife of 
William H. Cozens, of Swedesboro. 

Throughout his residence in Gloucester county Air. Allen followed the 
occupation of farming and a glance indicated to the passersby the careful 
supervision which he bestowed upon his place. He followed practical and 
progressive methods, understood the rotation of crops, knew what kind 
of soil was needed for the different cereals, and so conducted his farming 
interests that he secured therefrom a handsome financial return that made 
him one of the wealthy men of Gloucester county. He was at all times 
honorable and upright in his dealings and just in his relations with his 
fellow men, very loyal to his friends and such qualities gained for him the 
warm regard of all who knew him, and in his death the community mourned 
the loss of one of its most valued citizens. 



EDMUND S. HILDRETH. 

The name of Hildreth figures conspicuously on the pages of New Jersey's 
history. From an early period in the development of the state its representa- 
tives have been prominent in public affairs, and have been active in advanc- 
ing the commercial and indu.'^trial interests which have led to the substantial 
upbuilding and progress of the localities with which they have been con- 
nected. Two centuries have probably passed since three brothers of the 
name of Hildreth, leaving the little rock-ribbed country of Wales, crossed 
the broad Atlantic to the New World and located on Long Island. One 
remained there, but the other two afterward came to this state. One of 
these brothers was David Hildreth, who took up his abode at Rio Grande. 
He and his wife, Sarah Hildreth, were the parents of Joshua Hildreth, the 
great-grandfather of our subject. Joshua was the first judge of Cape May 
county, and wielded a strong influence on the public life of this section 
of the state. 

Ephraim Hildreth, the grandfather, was born at Rio Grande, and 
engaged in merchandising at that place for many years. He helped to build 
a vessel for service in the war of 18 12, a brig for the privateer service: but 
when it was almost ready for use it was burned by thg British. His death 
occurred when he was about forty-five years of age. In his family were 
two (laughters and three sons. Edmund went to sea when twentv-two

years of age. with about eighteen others from Rio Grande, bound for 
Charleston, South Carolina, and in a storm at sea all were lost. Swain 
was killed by a stroke of lightning while on a vessel ofif the coast of Norfolk, 
Virginia. Jane H. married David T. Smith, now a retired sea captain at 
Cape May Court House. Lydia married Captain Morris Cresse, who com- 
manded a vessel, and they had two children, Addie and Jeremiah. The 
grandfather died about 1842, at the age of forty-five years, and the grand- 
mother passed away in 1884, at the advanced age of eighty-six years. 

George Hildreth, the father of our subject, was born at Rio Grande, in 
1822, at one time made his home at Cold Spring, and for forty years prior 
to his death was a resident of Cape May. He became a sea captain and 
owned a vessel before he was twenty-five years of age. He built the 
Columbia Hotel, the largest hotel in Cape May at that time, the building 
and grounds occupying four squares. He was not then twenty-two years 
of age^ — a fact which indicates how early he became prominently connected 
with the business interests of his native country. He was entirely a self- 
made man. and though he acquired a handsome capital he often remarked 
that he never felt so rich in his life as when he possessed twelve pennies.- 
which he had secured by selling rabbits. For three years Mr. Hildreth 
conducted his hotel, and then sold it to John C. Bullitt for twenty-two 
thousand dollars. Subsequently he built the first factory for the manu- 
facture of oil secured from the menhaden fish, caught in Delaware Bay, 
and had a number of sloops for carrying the fish to the factory. The oil 
sold for a dollar and a half per gallon, and the investment proved a profitable 
one. After conducting the enterprise for a time he sold out for twelve 
thousand dollars in gold. He then, in 1865. established the flour and feed 
business now carried on by our subject, and successfully conducted the 
store until his death. He built the West End Hotel and many cottages, 
including Carroll Villa, the Wyoming, Columbia House and many smaller 
ones. Through his varied and extensive business interests he acquired a 
handsome competence, and was not only prominent in business affairs, but 
was also a leader in public thought and movement. He was one of the 
first commissioners of Cape May, being associated on the board with ^^^ J. 
Sewell, John C. Bullitt, and J. Q. Williams. He was the agent for the 
New York Board of Underwriters for southern New Jersey, was the 
keeper of the life-saving station for nineteen years, and organized the first 
wrecking crew at Cape May. He always owned a number of boats, and 
his splendid executive, ability and indefatigable energy enabled him to suc- 
cessfullv control his many interests. At the same time he took an active 
part in whatever tended to prove of public benefit, and his labors largely 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 549 

promoted the welfare of the town. His poHtical support was given the 
RepubHcan party. 

George Hildreth was united in marriage to Miss Sarali AI. Worrell, 
and to them were born two sons and four daughters : Millicent, the wife of 
J. L. Richardson, the postmaster of Cape May; Georgie, the widow of 
I. A. Garrison, who was engaged in the insurance business in Cape May 
and died in 1897; Lydia, the wife of Milton Marcy, of Illinois; Edmund, of 
this review; Lewis, who married Maud Schillinger and is engaged in farming, 
and Susie M., who completes the family. The father died November 25, 
1897, and the mother passed away in 1880. wdien fifty-two years of age. 

Edmund Swain Hildreth, a worthy representative of tliis prominent 
family, was born in the city of Cape May, July 24, 1859, and in the public 
schools of the county pursued his preliminary education, which was sup- 
plemented by study in the South Jersey Institute at Bridgeton. and a two- 
years' course in the State Normal School at Trenton, where he was gradu- 
ated in 1878. He subsequently took a commercial course in Pierce's Busi- 
ness College, where he was graduated in 1879, and, thus well equipped for 
the practical duties of Hfe, he entered his father's store, where he occupied 
a clerical position until 1881. He then took a crip throug'h the west, return- 
ing after three years. From 1884 until 1898 he was engaged in the oyster 
planting business at Cape May, and enjoyed an extensive trade, his sales 
exceeding those of all the other oyster merchants in the town. He raised 
from ten to twenty bushels of plants annually, and his large shi]Mnents 
brought him excellent financial returns. Since November, 1897, '"'^ '^^^^ 
devoted his attention to the fiour and feed business, and now controls the 
most extensive enterprise in that line in the county, the store being eighty 
by two hundred feet and extending from Chestnut to Jackson streets. 
He employs eight men through the summer, and his patronage is steadily 
increasing, for his business methods are most honorable, and he carries 
a high grade of flour and feed. 

On the 3d of August, 1887, Mr. Hildreth was united in marriage to 
Miss Kate Willig, a daughter of Edw^ard Willig, of Philadelphia, and to 
them have been born two children — Edna and Norma. They make their 
home in Cape May, and occupy an enviable position in the circles of society 
where intelligence and culture are the characteristics of the members. Mr. 
Hildreth is a man of sterling worth, of pleasant manner, of social qualities 
and genial disposition. His friends are many and maintain for him a high 
regard. His business methods are practical and progressive, safe and hon- 
orable, and his capable management is annually augmenting his capital. 



5SO BIOGRAPHICAL HISTUKY OF THE FIRST 

SAMUEL E. EWING. 

In the liattle of the Boynei — one of the most famous military engage- 
ments known to history — Finley Ewing, of Londonderry, Ireland, fought 
with such gallantry and bravery that he was publicly complimented by King- 
William III, who also presented him with a sword. From that gallant 
warrior Samuel Eldredge Ewing is descended, being of Scotch-Irish lineage. 
In the years which have since passed, the name has figured conspicuously 
in connection with many important events; and since Thomas Ewing, a son 
of the hero of Boyne, came to America in 1718 its representatives here have 
left the impress of their individuality upon the public life of the state and 
nation. Thomas Ewing took up his abode in Cumberland county. New 
Jersey, where he died, leaving a numerous progeny. Among his descendants 
are numbered General Thomas Ewing, at one time a United States senator 
from Ohio and at another the secretary of the treasury, and his sister, who 
became the wife of General William T. Sherman. 

Jeremiah Ewing, the grandfather of Samuel Ewing resided at Cold 
Spring, Cape May county, and was one of the most extensive farmers in this 
section of the state, his farm being two miles square. He was regarded as 
one of the wealthy men of that time, and was also prominent as a leader of 
public opinion in his community. He loyally served his country in the 
navy during the war of the Revolution, and was active in promoting the 
cause of independence. His political support was afterward given the Dem- 
ocracy, and in his religious faith he was a Presbyterian. He was twice 
married and his children were: Leaming, the father of our subject; Jere- 
miah, who died in early manhood; Christopher, who died in childhood; 
David, a ])rominent educator and county superintendent of the schools of 
Ca]5e May county, who died at the age of seventy-two years; Rev. Robert, 
who engaged in teaching school in Indiana, and afterward became a Presby- 
terian clergyman : he was married in Indiana, and died in early manhood, 
leaving two children — Livingstone and Mrs. E. Barnett; Sarah became the 
wife of William Cummings, a carriage-builder living at Fishing Creek, Cape 
May county, by whom she had three children. — Samuel, Mary Louise and 
William; and Lydia became the wife of Seth Miller, a farmer at Green Creek, 
Cape May county, and their children are James, Seth, Obed (deceased) and 
Mary C, the wife of W. B. Miller, ex-senator from Cape May county, one 
of the most prominent men of this section of the state. The paternal grand- 
father of our subject died at the age of seventy-four years. 

Leaming Ewing was born at Cold Spring, Cape May county. New Jersey, 
in 1794, acquired a good education and engaged in teaching school. Later 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW lERSEY. 551 

he devoted his energies to the cultivation of the old homestead farm upon 
which he spent his remaining days. He took part in the coast defense in 
the war of ]8i2, and was ever a loyal and public-spirited citizen. With the 
Presbyterian church he held membership, and in his political faith he was 
a Democrat. He was twice married, his first union being with Joanna 
Woolson. Their eldest child, Eliza Ann, died in early girlhood. Jeremiah 
died in childhood. Mary became the wife of Elijah Hand, now deceased, 
by whom she had six children : Mary, Learning E., Charles E., Emma, 
Elijah and Isabel; but the Vast two are now deceased. Lydia is the wife of 
John Nobb and has two daughters, — Mary E. and Kate. Eliza became the 
wife of Samuel Bornell. William married Isabel Robinson at Carlisle. Penn- 
sylvania, and has three children, — Alexander, William and Nettie. Robert 
served as a soldier in the civil war and died from the effects of the service; 
and James married Emma Stratton, by whom he had five children : George, 
Learning. Bellford, Myra and Ella. He served throughout the civil war 
under three enlistments. He was first a member of Company F, New Jersey 
Volunteers, later joined the marine service and lastly w-as a member of the 
heavy artillery. After the death of his first wife. Learning Ewing married 
Mary Inmans. the widow of his half-brother Robert, and by this second 
union was born a son, Samuel Eldredge, whose name heads this sketch. The 
father died at the age of seventy-four years, and the mother passed away in 
1843. 

Mr. Ewing. who is now one of the most prominent and influential citi- 
zens of Cape May county, was born at the old family homestead in Cold 
Spring, October 21. 1845. and in the common schools acquired his education; 
but at the age of sixteen put aside his books and worked at farming for two 
years. At the age of eighteen he went to sea, sailing on merchant vessels 
engaged in the coasting trade and in trade with the West Indies. Steadily 
he worked his way upward, his diligence and faithfulness winning him pro- 
motion until he was made captain. At different times he commanded the 
William A. Steelman, the Florence, the Mary S. Ewing, which he built and 
owned, and a number of other vessels. He sailed for other people and con- 
tinued his seafaring life until 1881. when he returned to Cape May county 
and became engaged in general contracting, building sea walls, bridges, 
moving houses and doing other contract work. In this line he emplovs as 
many as sixty men. 

His business interests, however, are extensive and of varied character. 
He has been the proprietor of the Shoreham Hotel for two years, the largest 
hotel on Cape May Point, having accommodations for two hundred and 



552 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST [ 

fifty people. Most of the rooms command a splendid view of the ocean, and 
the hotel is eciual in appointments and accommodations to the best in the 
state. There are broad verandahs, spacious halls, cool parlors, a fine dining- 
room and offices equipped in the most modern style. Mr. Ewing was also 
engaged in merchandising at Schellinger Landing, and has devoted his ener- 
gies in a measure to the fire insurance business, and is quite extensively en- 
gaged in the real-estate business, buying and selling property. He was also a 
member of the board of trade and was director in the Cape May Saving Fund 
Building & Loan Association for twelve years. These many business in- 
terests, so varied in character, plainly indicate the superior ability and enter- 
prise of Mr. Ewing. His judgment is rarely at fault, and, as he is quick 
to plan and determined in the execution of his plans, he has won prosperity 
and gained a place among the capitalists of southern New Jersey. He has 
followed a safe, conservative policy, yet is progressive and energetic, and 
whatever he has undertaken he has carried forward to successful completion. 

In the public affairs of the county he has ever taken a deep interest and 
has loyally served his fellow citizens in a number of important positions. 
He has been three times the mayor of West Cape May, and for two terms 
has been a member of the board of chosen freeholders. He has also served 
on the board of education and as collector and treasurer of West Cape May, 
and ever exercises his official prerogatives to advance the substantial up- 
building and progress of the community. He was a member of the Pres- 
byterian church at Cold Spring and is a member and trustee of the Cape 
Presbyterian chapel in West Cape May. Socially he is connected with Cape 
Island Lodge, No. 30, F. & A. M.. with the Ancient Order of United Work- 
men and the Independent Order of Heptasophs. 

In 187 1 was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Ewing and Miss Mary S., 
a daughter of Abijah D. Reeves, a farmer of Cape May county. New Jersey. 
Mrs. Ewing died April 28, 1897, at the age of forty-four years, leaving four 
children : Amanda is the wife of Southard Eldredge, of West Cape May, 
and they had two children. Southard, who died at the age of six months, 
and Mary E. ; and Samuel, Allen and Leslie are at home. 

While his ancestors won prominence in political and military life Mr. 
Ewing has become no less distinguished in commercial circles, and it is to 
commercial activity that the prosperity and development of a county, state 
and nation are due. As a business man he has been enterprising, energetic 
and always abreast of the times, and has been rewarded by an ample fortune. 
He commands respect wherever he is known and no history of southern New 
Jersey would be complete without the record of his career.

WILLIAM CLARK HUNTER. 

In fraternal circles Mr. Hunter is widely known throughout the country 
as a promoter of the Knights of the Golden Eagle, and in Swedesboro he 
is accounted a leading business man, having for a number of years occupied 
the position of traveling representative for the house of John Lucas & 
Company, the well-known paint manufacturer. He was born in Chatham, 
Chester county, Pennsylvania, on the 30th of May, 1854, and is a son of 
William C. and Isabella W. (Wiley) Hunter, the former a native of Ireland 
and the latter of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were of Scotch- 
Irish origin, and the father belonged to the famous Bucktail Regiment dur- 
ing the civil war. He served as its quartermaster and remained at the front 
until the cessation of hostilities, but died in 1865. His wife, long surviving 
him, passed away in 1894, at the age of sixty-eight years. In their family 
were six children, namely: Christiana W., wife of Oscar S. Sellers, of Ches- 
ter county, Pennsylvania; John M., a carpenter and contractor living in 
Swedesboro; Elizabeth, wife of Henry Burke, of Philadelphia; William C; 
Isabella W., who died at the age of fourteen years; and Walter, who occupies 
the position of shipping clerk for the firm of John Lucas & Company. 

Mr. Hunter of this review obtained his preliminary education in the 
public schools of Chester county, Pennsylvania, aftenvard was a student in 
Professor Huggins' school in Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, and completed his edu- 
cation in the Soldiers' Orphan School of Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, in which 
he was graduated with the class of 187 1. In the meantime his mother 
and eldest brother had removed to Swedesboro, and when he had left the 
schoolroom he accepted a position as bookkeeper in the office of John 
Moore, of that town, with whom he remained for a vear After a short

time spent as clerk in the store of Ephraim Waters, he entered tipon an 
apprenticeship at the carpenter's trade, and was thus engaged for two years. 
On the expiration of that period he secured a situation in the store of Charles 
D. Lippencott, where he continued for three years, and then spent three 
years in the employ of A. W. Wright & Company, of Philadelphia, acting 
as salesman in the store a part of the time and as traveling representative 
on the road. In 1879 he entered the employ of John Lucas & Company, 
and after six months spent in the office was placed upon the road, and has 
since continued to sell goods for that house to the trade. At first his terri- 
tory included New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania. West Vir- 
ginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and in those states he 
laid the foundation for such an extensive patronage that ten men are now 
required to control the trade. Mr. Hunter is recognized as one of the 
most able traveling salesmen representing the paint business in the United 
States, and therefore commands a very excellent salary. His twenty-one 
years' connection with the firm of John Lucas & Company plainly indicates 
his fidelity to the house and his marked ability in the line of his chosen 
vocation. His manner is always genial, courteous and obliging, and as 
his business methods are strictly reliable he has won the confidence of the 
trade in an unusual degree. 

Mr. Hunter was married on the 28th of January, 1886, to Miss Johanna 
B. Fox, a daughter of George Fox, of Harrisonville, New Jersey, and to 
them have been born two childreiir— Herbert F. and Irene B. In 1891 he 
erected a beautiful residence on Railroad avenue, in Swedesboro, and this 
attractive home is noted for its gracious hospitality, while in social circles 
Mr. and Mrs. Hunter occupy a very prominent position. 

Mr. Hunter has a wide acquaintance in fraternal circles, and enjoys the 
warm regard of all with whom he has thus been brought in contact. He 
is past master of Swedesboro Lodge. No. 157. F. & A. M., also belongs to 
Osceola Lodge. No. 75, I. O. O. F. and Diamond Council, Junior Order of 
United American Mechanics He is a member of the Sons of Veterans, and 
was formerly captain of Philadelphia Camp, No. 16. While he has been 
active in all these orders his chief interest is centered in the Knights of the 
Golden Eagle and in Coeur de Lion Castle. No. 36. in which he has filled 
all the offices, and was chosen grand chief of New Jersey in 1896. He was 
appointed supreme chief of the United States, in June. 1898. and to that 
office was elected on the loth of October, of the same year. He was a most 
efficient and capable supreme chief, and during his incumbency he visited 
many states in his official capacity. His keen discrimination, his unfaiHng 
courtesy and his deep interest in the order made him particularly well

qualified to advance its interests, and lie is therefore widely and favorably 
known throughout the organization. In politics Mr. Hunter is a stanch 
Republican, and represented his township on the executive board of the 
county. He has frequently dedined political honors, preferring to devote 
his energies to other duties. In Swedesboro. where he has so long made his 
home, he is very popular and his circle of friends throughout the country is 
almost co-equal with his circle of acquaintances. 



CHARLES M. WILKINS. 

The growth and upbuilding of the connnunity depends upon the efforts 
of its enterprising citizens, for prosperity is due to commercial activitv. 
Mr. Wilkins is to-day a well-known representative of the industrial affairs 
of Philadelphia, but maintains his residence at Wenonah. He was born in 
the former place, September ii, 1853. and is a representative of a prominent 
old family of the Keystone state. 

His parents were Joseph L. and Mardie V. (Mansure) ,\Vilkins. On the 
paternal side he is descended from English Quaker stock, his ancestors lia\- 
ing located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the early part of the eight- 
eenth century. On the maternal side he is of French-Huguenot ancestry, 
but he takes greater pride in the fact that he is an American rather than in 
any knowledge of his ancestors, of whom his information is limited. The 
paternal grandfather, Charles Wilkins. was a native of Montgomery county, 
Pennsylvania. Joseph L. Wilkins. the father of our subject, was Ixmu in 
Philadelphia and engaged in coal-mining and shipping. He was a very 
prominent Mason and a well-known and highly respected citizen. He mar- 
ried Mardie Mansure. a daughter of Robert Mansure, and they became the 
parents of eleven children, — five sons and six daughters, — of whom seven 
are yet living. 

Charles M. Wilkins spent his boyhood days in Brooklyn, New York, to 
which place he removed with his father's family in i860. He attended the 
public and private schools of New York and Brooklyn. His father was 
engaged in the wholesale coal trade in the former city, but met with business 
reverses and with his family returned to Philadelphia in 1870. His illness 
and death threw the burden of the family support on the older children and 
thus they were compelled to seek employment. Charles M. Wilkins secured 
a situation in a wholesale drug house in Philadelphia, where he remained 
for several years, and in 1875 he entered the employ of the well-known firm 
of Partrick & Carter, manufacturers of electrical supplies, as bookkeeper.

his younger brother, E. Ward Wilkins, being an employe of the firm at 
that time. In 1884 the Wilkins brothers were admitted to a partnership in 
the business, and when within a year James Partrick, the founder of the 
house, died, his interest was purchased by the Messrs. Wilkins. Tlie business 
is now carried on under the firm name of Partrick, Carter & Wilkins, our 
subject and his brother owning two-thirds of the enterprise, of which they 
are the managers. 

The business career of C. M. Wilkins has been a very prosperous one. 
He is a man of excellent business and executive ability and his efforts have 
been by no means confined to one line. He is now the president of the Na- 
tional Electrical Trades' Association, an influential organization composed 
of the leading firms in this line in the United States, with headquarters in 
Chicago. He is also a prominent member of the National Association of 
Manufacturers and is connected with other business and trade associations 
throughout the country. His long identification with the electrical trade has 
made him well known in such circles throughout the United States and 
Canada. 

In the fall of 1885 Mr. Wilkins took up his residence in Wenonah and has 
since been prominently identified with every movement for the advancement 
of the public welfare, giving freely of his time and money in support of all 
measures calculated to prove of general good. In politics he is a stalwart 
Republican, taking an active interest in the politics of the county and state 
and keeping well informed on the issues of the day. The cause of education 
finds in him a warm friend, and during his incumbency as president of the 
school board the beautiful school-house, which is the pride of -Wenonah, was 
erected largely through his influence and efforts. He has served for many 
years as a member of the borough council, and at the election held in the 
spring of 1889 was chosen as mayor. Mr. Wilkins is the president of the 
AA'enonah Library Association, of which he was one of the organizers. He 
has done effective service for his party as a member of the Republican county 
executive committee for Gloucester county, has been chosen as a delegate to 
state and congressional conventions and was a member of the St. Louis con- 
vention of 1896, which nominated McKinley for the first time. 

On the 2 1 St of November, 1878, Mr. Wilkins was united in marriage to 
Harriet C. Little, of Hudson. New York, a daughter of George L. Little, 
who came from a representative old New England family that was estab- 
lished on the banks of the Hudson river at the close of the Revolutionarv 
war. The home life of Mr. and Mrs. Wilkins has been an exceptional! v 
happy one, and their beautiful residence is noted for its gracious and cordial 
hospitality, for its good cheer and good fellowship. They have two daugh-

ters: Julia Rose, a student in Bortlentown College; and Edna Browninsj-, a 
pupil in the school in Wenonah. 

A man of scholarly attainments and tastes. Mr. Wilkins has one of the 
finest private libraries to be found in south Jersey. He has always been an 
extensive reader and is an enthusiastic lover and collector of books. His 
library contains several thousand volumes, with the contents of which he is 
perfectly familiar, and his knowledge of books and his good judgment have 
enabled him to place upon his shelves many rare and elegant examples of the 
bookmakers' art, some of which can be duplicated only at great cost. His 
library covers every branch of literature and represents a collection made 
during more than twenty years, embracing a wide range of subjects. His 
comprehensive familiarity with books has enabled him to select them with 
definite purpose and to classify them so that one seeking information along 
certain lines may easily find the necessary volumes. 

Mr. Wilkins is connected with the Presbyterian church and is active in 
the various departments of church work, serving as an elder of the church 
and the superintendent of the Sunday-school. Dr. T. L. Cuyler has said: 
"Character is not determined by a single act, but by habitual conduct;" and 
an evidence of Mr. Wilkins' honorable and well spent life is found in the high 
regard in which he is uniformly held by those among whom he has lived for 
many years. He has been an important factor in business circles, and his 
popularity is well deserved, as in him are embraced the characteristics of an 
unbending integrity, unabating energy and industry that never flags. 



E. WARD WILKINS. 



The unostentnfiors routine of private life, although of vast importance 
to the welfare of the majority, has not figured to any great extent in the 
pages of history: but the names of men who have distinguished themselves 
by the possession of those qualities of character which mainly contribute 
to the success of private life and to the public stability, and who have en- 
joyed the respect and confidence of those around them should not be per- 
mitted to perish. Their example is more valuable to the majority of 
readers than that of heroes, warriors, statesmen and diplomats, as they 
indicate patlis of usefulness which lead to gaining the livelihood for which 
the greater number of humanity must strive. Mr. \\'ilkins is one who in 
the busy affairs of life has gained advancement, and by reason of his 
marked ability in his chosen calling has become known throughout the 
country in electrical circles. He is now a partner in the firm of Partrick.

Carter & Wilkins, manufacturers of and dealers in electrical supplies in 
Philadelphia. 

Mr. Wilkins was born in that city, March 21, 1859. His family history 
is given in the preceding sketch. In 1873 he became a clerk in the house 
where he is now a partner. His close application to business, the ability with 
which he mastered electrical work in all its departments and his marked fidel- 
ity led to his promotion from time to time. His brother, Charles M. Wilkins, 
had become an employe of the firm in the capacity of bookkeeper, and in 
1884 both were admitted to a partnership and the firm has since been known 
as Partrick, Carter & Wilkins. The business was originally established in 
1867, by James Partrick, who died in 1884. The present partners con- 
ducting trade under the above firm name are Franklin S. Carter, Charles 
M. Wilkins and E. Ward Wilkins, all of whom have been connected with 
the house from its early days. This is one of the oldest and largest houses 
in the United States manufacturing electrical supplies. 

E. Ward Wilkins is a practical electrician, thoroughly familiar with 
all branches of the business, and has traveled all over the country in the 
interest of his firm. Pie has the distinction of being the first man who 
ever traveled for the express purpose of selling electrical supplies. He is 
a charter member of the Electric Light Association of the United States 
and was the prime mover and active spirit in the organization of the 
National Electrical Supply Dealers' Association. The firm manufactures ' 
and deals in electrical supplies and their business has now assumed ex- 
tensive proportions, their output being very large. They have an exhibit 
of goods in Paris, Cuba, Venezuela and China, and the house sustains an 
unassailable reputation for reliability. Mr. Wilkins has entire charge of 
the manufacturing and sales departments of the firm. 

In October, 1883, was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Wilkins and 
Miss Anna M. Winship, a daughter of E. R. Winship, of Philadelphia, and 
they now have three children: Lena W., a student in Bordentown Col- 
lege; Myra D. and Warren W., who attend the Wenonah school. The 
family are members of the Presbyterian church of Wenonah, in which 
Mr. Wilkins is serving as a trustee. Socially he is connected with the 
Masonic fraternity, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Junior 
Order of American Mechanics. He is also a member of the Franklin 
Institute. He has a beautiful home in Wenonah. and its gracious hos- 
pitality has made it a favorite resort with the many friends of the familv. 
Mr. Wilkins is a Republican in politics, and while not taking an active 
part in political work has always been zealous for the success of his partv. 
He has twice been elected on the Republican ticket as commissioner of

appeals. He is an ardent sportsman with gun and rod and every season 
goes in pursuit wherever game can be found. He is also an enthusiastic 
lover of field sports and athletics. 



ROBERT- A. BRANDIFF. 

Robert A. Brandiff is a contractor and builder residing in Salem, Salem 
county. New Jersey, who has won an enviable reputation in his line of 
work as a skilled mechanic who puts his best efforts in the work before him. 
He is a son of John and Ann (Atkinson) BrandifY and was born December 
2, 1862, in Elsinboro township, this county. 

John Brandif? was a native of Lower Penn's Neck, and lost his father 
when he was a small lad. He worked on a farm for many years, but later 
moved to this city, where he is at present engaged in conducting a grocery. 
He is a Democrat, and has held a number of local offices. He is a free- 
holder and is enthusiastic in upholding his views. He is also a member of 
the Improved Order of Red Men. As his life companion he chose Miss 
Ann Atkinson, and to them were born five sons and three daughters, viz. : 
Charles, who married Miss Ella Dunham and follows the trade of a mason; 
Caroline, who married John Pedrick. a salesman and farmer; John H., a 
can-maker, who married Miss Maggie Franklin; Robert A., our subject; 
Elizabeth, who married William Townsend, a glass-blower; Frank, a can- 
maker, who married Marie Slape; Lucy, who married Norman Woodside, 
a glass-blower; and Raymond, who married Miss Emma Bacon. The 
mother died at the age of sixty-five years, and the father at the age of 
sixty-seven. 

Robert A. Brandiff spent his boyhood upon the farm, and became 
fainiliar with every detail of the work there. After following this occupa- 
tion for a few years he learned the trade of mason, and for eight years 
worked at his trade as a joumeyman. He then engaged for himself as a 
contractor and builder, and obtained all the work he could do. He formed 
a partnership with Joseph H. Boon, and they now do a great deal of both 
city and country work, employing twenty men and being busy all the time. 
They were the first contractors engaged in the construction of Fort Mott, 
and were also employed in building Fort Delaware, at Delaware City, and 
several of the best bridges of this country are the work of his skill — among 
them Hancock's bridge. Hook and Lower Canawa bridges, and a number 
of others. His work is always satisfactory to his employers, and a standing 
recommendation of his ability. He is at present engaged in the erection of 
the Shaffer House. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 561 

January 15, 1888, were celebrated the nuptials of Mr. Brandiff and Miss 
Ann Parker, a daughter of Wesley Parker. Five children have blessed 
their home and added their bright presence to the cheerful fireside, two 
of whom have preceded their parents to their heavenly home, there to await 
a joyful reunion. They are Laura, deceased; Carrie, Rebecca, Jennie, de- 
ceased, and Wesley. Mr. Brandifif is connected with a number of fraternal 
orders, being a member of the Knights of the Golden Eagle and Washington 
Lodge, L O. O. F., and is interested in the Franklin Building and Loan 
Association. He lends a ready assistance to any movement for the advance- 
ment of public prosperity, and is the kind of citizen that is of material help 
to any community. 



WILLIAM J. FREAS. 



The records of the lives of our forefathers are of interest to the modern 
citizen, not alone for their historical value but also for the inspiration and 
example they afford; yet we need not look exclusively to the past. Al- 
though surroundings may differ, the essential conditions of human life are 
ever the same, and a man can learn from the success of those around him 
if he will heed the obvious lessons contained in their history. Turn to the 
life record of William Johnson Freas, study carefully the plans and methods 
he has followed and you will learn of superior powers of management, and 
that keen perception, untiring energy, unbounded enterprise and great 
sagacity have been the important factors in his success. He is now a mem- 
ber of the firm of Stiles & Freas, proprietors of the leading dry-goods house 
of Salem, and is accorded by his fellow townsmen a foremost place in the 
ranks of the representative business men of the city. 

Mr. Freas was born in Elsinboro township, Salem county, July 9. 1859, 
and is a son of Johnson and Elizabeth O. (Hewitt) Freas. The family is 
of German origin and was founded in America by Henry Freas, the great- 
grandfather of our subject, who crossed the Atlantic to the New World. 
The grandfather. Judge Henry Freas, resided in Lower Neck and Salem 
townships, this county, but died in the village of Salem. He was a farmer 
by occupation, owned some valuable farming property, was an extensive 
real-estate dealer and a man of considerable means. His political support 
was given the Democracy, and he took an active interest in promoting the 
growth and success of the party. He was also honored with political ofifice 
and served as sheriff as well as judge of Salem county. His decisions on the 
bench were marked by impartiality and few appeals were ever taken there- 
from. In business matters as well he was known for his thorough relia- 



562 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

bility and good judgment. In politics he was a Democrat, and in religions 
belief was a Baptist. His children, ten in number, were Henry, James, 
Reuben, Johnson, William, Daniel, Samuel, Elizabeth Bacon, Ann Shep- 
pard and Lucy Fox. 

Johnson Freas, the father of our subject, was born in Lower Penn's Neck 
township, and afterward followed farming in that township and in Manning- 
ton, Penn's Neck and Elsinboro townships. He spent his last days in 
Salem and was engaged in the manufacture of brick for a time, but after- 
ward lived retired. In politics he was a Democrat, and was at one time a 
candidate for the general assembly. In his religious faith he was a Baptist. 
His family numbered four children. One of the sons, Henry Freas, married 
Elizabeth Hand and had four children. He was a dry-goods merchant and 
is now deceased. 

William J. Freas attended the public schools of Salem until twelve years 
of age, and soon afterward started out to earn his own livelihood and aid 
in the support of his widowed mother. He was first employed in the Craven 
Glass Works, at Salem, where he remained three years, and then accepted 
a clerkship in the employ of his brother in the dry-goods business, and there 
remained for fifteen years, during which time he mastered the business in 
every detail. In 1889 he became associated with Mr. Stiles, and the firm of 
Stiles & Freas has from the beginning maintained a place in the foremost 
ranks of the mercantile interests of the city. They are now conducting 
the most extensive dry-goods business in Salem, and one of the largest in 
southern New Jersey, and employ a large corps of clerks. Their sales-room, 
which is twenty-five by one hundred feet in dimensions, is fitted up in 
modem metropolitan style with all the latest improvements and conveni- 
ences. Their stock embraces everything found in a first-class dry-goods 
establishment, and their trade has grown to mammoth proportions for a 
city the size of Salem. They have recently extended the field of their labors 
by adding a new and important department to their business, the manufac- 
ture of ladies' wrappers. This furnishes employment to thirty people, and 
is adding materially to the income of the firm. 

In his political views Mr. Freas is a stalwart Democrat and is now serv- 
ing as a member of the board of chosen free-holders from the west ward of 
Salem. He also held that office in 1887, and at dififerent times has been a 
delegate to the various conventions of his party. He is a member of the 
Hook and Ladder Company and is the secretary of the board of trade. 
Socially he is connected with Ivanhoe Council, No. 5, K. G. E. ; Fenwick 
Lodge, I. O. O. F., and the Ancient Order of United Workmen. 

On the 1 2th of May, 1890, Mr Freas was united in marriage to Miss 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 563 

Dora B. Leigh, a daughter of Joseph Leigh, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
and they have three children, — Maud L., Russel Conwell and Norman S. 
The last named died in infancy. The family occupy a prominent position 
in social circles and the Freas household is noted for its hospitality. Such 
in brief is the life history of one of the most successful and enterprising mer- 
chants of Salem. He enjoys the well earned distinction of being what the 
public calls "a self-made man." His career has been remarkably successful, 
chiefly by reason of his natural ability and his thorough insight into the 
business in which as a young salesman he embarked. His strict integrity, 
financial conservatism and business judgment have always been so univer- 
sally recognized that Mr. Freas has enjoyed the public confidence to an 
enviable degree, and naturally this has brought him such a lucrative patron- 
age that through times of general prosperity and general adversity alike he 
has witnessed a steady increase in his business, until to-day it is one of the 
most flourishing in its line in southern New Jersey. 

He also has ever had a hearty concern for the public welfare. It is true 
that his chief life-work has beeii that of a remarkably successful merchant, 
but the range of his activities and the scope of his influence have reached 
far beyond this special field. He belongs to that class of men who wield a 
power that is all the more potent from the fact that it is moral rather than 
political, and is exercised for the public weal rather than for personal ends. 
Regarded as a citizen and in his social relations, he belongs to that public- 
spirited, useful and helpful type of men whose ambitions and desires are 
centered and directed in those channels through which flow the greatest and 
most permanent good to the greatest number. 



HARRY McCOLLISTER. 

This gentleman is well known in professional circles in Swedesboro, 
where he is engaged in teaching instrumental music. He was born in 
Bridgeport, New Jersey, October 20, 1863, and is a son of Benjamin F. 
and Charlotte Ann (Justice) McCollister. The family is of Irish extraction. 
The early authentic records of which our subject has cognizance states that 
John McCollister and his wife, Rebecca, were residents of Salem county. 
Their son, Isaac McCollister, was a weaver by trade but in later life followed 
farming. He was married in 1793 to Mary Stiver, and his death occurred in 
Sharptown, New Jersey, August 19, 1838, while his wife passed away Sep- 
tember 17, 1806. Their children were: John, who was born March 28, 



564 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

1794, and died March 6, 1796; Archibald, who was born November 15, 

1795, and died July 20, 1817; Beulah, who was born August 2, 1798, and 
died August 7, 1819; Mary, who was born April 16, 1801, and died in early 
childhood; and Isaac, who was born July 21, 1804, and died August ig, 
1838. After the death of his first wife the father of this family was again 
married, March 13, 1809, his second union being with Elizabeth Keen, 
daughter of Elijah and Mary Keen. She was born February 14, 1780, and 
died December 16, 1847. By her marriage she became the mother of five 
children: Elijah, who was born March 26, 1810, died on the 3d of Novem- 
ber of the same year; Rachel, born September 13, 181 1, married Matthew 
DuBois, and died in Everett, Pennsylvania, October 5, 1880; Moses, born 
April 15, 1814, died February 25, 1830; Aaron, born September 7, 1816, 
died October 2, 1836; and Benjamin Franklin was bom October i, 1818. 

The last nained, the father of our subject, acquired his education in the 
common schools of Salem county and in early life studied surveying, which 
he has followed at intervals throughout his business career. In 1838 he 
began teaching school and was thus employed for two years in Sharptown, 
New Jersey, and spent one year as a teacher two miles above Penn Grove 
and two years in that town. He represented Salem county in the legislature, 
although he accepted the office much againt his desire. On the expiration 
of his term he again resumed teaching, being connected with the educational 
interests near Penn Grove for one year. He afterward spent five years as a 
teacher in the town, was for three years a teacher in Bridgeport, and then 
went to Illinois, where he taught for two years. Being an able mathe- 
matician, he was then invited by Benjamin Naylor, author of Naylor's 
Speedy Calculator, to join him in conducting a school eight miles from 
Lafayette. Indiana. There he remained for one year, during which time he 
formed a key to the calculator just mentioned. Subsequently, in connection 
with Mr. Naylor and William B. Lauler, he conducted a large school in 
Richland, Iowa, for three years, his students coming from that state, Illinois 
and Indiana. The outbreak of the civil war, however, seriously interfered 
with the success of the institution; so Mr. McCollister returned to Bridge- 
port, New Jersey, where he was engaged in teaching for three years. Sub- 
sequentlv he was a teacher in Swedesboro for one year and for one year 
conducted a private school in Battentown. On the expiration of that period 
he again returned to Bridgeport, where a five-years' service in the school- 
room completed his educational work. Soon afterward he removed to 
Swedesboro, where he has since earned on a conveyancing and surveying 
business. In this line his long experience with calculation proves of great 
value to him. He won an enviable reputation in connection with educational 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 565 

work, having the ability to impart clearly and concisely to others the knowl- 
edge he had acquired. 

On the 1 6th of April, 1846, Mr. McCollister was united in marriage to 
Miss Charlotte Ann Justice, a daughter of Nicholas Justice, of Pedrickstown, 
New Jersey. The children born of this union are : Elizabeth, who was born 
January 21, 1847, became the wife of James Sweeny and is now deceased; 
Anna, who was born December 22, 1848, is the wife of Thomas Norcross, 
of Swedesboro; Mary, who was born May 3, 1853, is the wife of William 
Norcross, of the same town; George, who was born August 6, i860, and 
died October 22, 1861; and Harry, the subject of this review. 

The last named obtained his education in the public schools of Bridge- 
port and Woodbury, New Jersey. He studied music in an institution in 
Philadelphia and also under a number of private instructors, attaining great 
proficiency in the "art divine." Of late years he has devoted his energies 
to piano and organ instruction, having through the past decade been re- 
garded as one of the leaders in this profession in New Jersey. He was a 
delegate to the national convention of the Music Teachers' Association in 
Cincinnati, in 189 1, and holds a very prominent position in professional 
circles. 

Mr. McCollister was married November 7, 1889, to Miss Mary C. Clark, 
daughter of Benjamin C. Clark, of Swedesboro, and they now have one child, 
Percival. Mr. McCollister is a member of the Ancient Order of United 
Workmen, and in his political affiliations is a Republican. He and his wife 
attend the Episcopal church and are very prominent in social circles, while 
their own home is noted for its kindly hospitality. 



J. C. HAZELTON. 



J. C. Hazelton, a well known citizen of Mullica Hill, was born in that 
place December 10, 1857. His father, J. W., and his grandfather, Stacy 
Hazelton, were also born there. J. W. followed the occupation of farming 
and at one time was a large land-owner. He was a prominent leatler in the 
Republican party of his county and was once elected to the United States 
congress. In religion he was a member of the Society of Friends. He mar- 
ried Martha Allen, who died in 1857. Of their six children four are living: 
J. C, F. Stacy, living at Woodstown; Samuel A., residing at Monroevilie; 
and Collins, living at Whig Lane. 

The subject of this sketch was educated at the common schools, spending

one year in the Westchester Normal State school. His life has been spent 
on the farm and he has always been a respected citizen. 

Mr. Hazleton is a member of the Methodist church and superintendent of 
the Sunday-school. For ten years he has been secretary of the local lodge 
of the Junior Order of American Mechanics. He was married March i6, 
1882, to Elizabeth, a daughter of J. J. Foster, of Jefferson, and they have 
two children, — Collins A., and Anna F. 



HENRY G. STEELMAN. 

That Mr. Steelman is one of the leading and influential citizens of Ocean 
City is evinced by the fact that he has on various occasions been called to 
public office by his fellow townsmen, who recognized his worth and ability 
and gave him their confidence and support. He well deserves mention 
among the representative men of Cape May county, and it is with pleasure, 
therefore, that we present to our readers the record of his career. He was 
born on the 3d of February, 1864, in Weymouth, Atlantic county, New 
Jersey, and is a son of Reuben and Caroline (Campbell) Steelman. 

The Steelman fam.ily is of English origin, and in early colonial days the 
first representative of the name in New Jersey took up his abode in Steel- 
ville, Atlantic county. The Campbells also were an early colonial family, 
and one of the ancestors of our subject served as a private in Washington's 
army at the time the patriots crossed the Delaware at Trenton, New Jersey. 
Frederick Steelman, the great-grandfather of our subject, resided near Steel- 
ville, Atlantic county, then a part of Gloucester county, where he owned a 
very large tract of land, comprising several thousand acres. He married 
Miss Scull, and their children w^ere as follows: Joseph, the grandfather of 
our subject, was the eldest. Sophia became the wife of David Smith, a sailor 
who resided at Steelville, and their children were : Phoebe, the wife of John 
Austin, and after his death she became the wife of Ludlum Hand; Sarah, 
the wife of Hosea McLean; Anna, the wife of Conley Somers; Edward; 
Ephraim; and David, who married Miss Collins. Judith became the wife 
of John Scull, a farmer, and their children were Susan, Benjamin, Richard, 
Edward, and Amelia, the wife of Robert Maloney. Experience became the 
wife of A. Steehnan, and they had one son, James. Elizabeth married 
Jonathan Scull. The great-grandfather of our subject died when forty-five 
or fifty years of age. 

Joseph Steelman, the grandfather, was born near Steelville and engaged 
in the lumber business at that place. He also carried on agricultural pur- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 567 

suits and was a man of industry and enterprise. He had eight children. 
Hannah, the eldest, became the wife of David Campbell, and their children 
were James, John, Hanson, Peter, Joseph and Sarah. The father of these 
children died, and Mrs. Steelman afterward married David Harris, a foundry- 
man, by whom she had two children, — Priscilla and Isaac. Naomi married 
Sanford Updike, a resident of Greenwich, New Jersey, and their children 
were: Joseph, Frederick, Sanford, Anna and Laura. Ann became the wife 
of Lewis Gififord, and after his death wedded John Thomas, by whom she 
had twin daughters, — Maggie and Ida. Roxanna became the wife of Wilson 
Cramer, of Pennsylvania, and had a son, Joseph. Margaret married God- 
fred Estlow, a resident of May's Landing, and their children were Anna. 
Lizzie, Ida, Winfield and Margaret. Joseph, now deceased, had the follow- 
ing named children: William; Reuben, deceased; Elizabetli, the wife of 
Alfred Lewis; Rebecca, the wife of David Everhart; and Alexina, who 
married Mr. Smallwood. David is deceased. Elizabeth, the youngest, 
became Mrs. Smith. 

Reuben Steelman, the father of our subject, was born in Steelville. June 
9, 1824. He was a sawyer and also followed the lumber business. For thirty 
years he was connected with that business at Weymouth, but since 1888 has 
been a resident of Ocean City, where he is now living a retired life. In his 
political affiliations he is a Republican, and in his religious belief is a Metho- 
dist. He married Miss Caroline Campbell, who died April 9, 1894, at the 
age of sixty-five years. In their family were five children, namely: Emma 
married Louis Risley, who is engaged in the yachting business and in boat- 
building; Jacob is the second; Maggie is the wife of Edward R. Sack, a 
teacher in the public schools of Ocean City, and they have two children, 
Emma and Caroline; Henry G. is the fourth in order of birth: and Lizzie 
is the wife of Charles S. Pryor, a life-insurance agent at Atlantic City, by 
whom she has a daughter. Ruby. 

Henry G. Steelman was graduated in the public schools and afterward 
engaged in working in a store in Weymouth. Later he carried on the 
grocery business, and in 1888 came to Ocean City, where he immediately 
established a grocery store. His trade constantly and rapidly increased 
until his quarters became too small and he erected a large building, in whicli 
he successfully conducted his store until 1894, when he sold that property 
to the Knights of Pythias. He then turned his attention to the lumber 
business at Ocean City, as a member of the firm of H. C. Steelman & Com- 
pany, and after two years he became a member of the firm of Howell & 
Steelman, his partner being Albeit H. Howell. A year later, however, he 



568 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

became connected with the real-estate interests of this place, and has erected 
here a number of residences. 

He has a comprehensive knowledge of realty values, and his jud2;ment is 
safe and reliable, so that he has made judicious investments which have 
brought him a good return for his capital. 

On the 4th of January, 1890, Mr. Steelman married Miss Ann Bour- 
geois, and in their pleasant home they entertain many of the best people of 
Ocean City, for their circle of friends is extensive. Mr. Steelman has long 
been actively identified with public affairs, and is at the present time the 
chief of the fire department here. From 1890 until 1893 he was the collector 
and treasurer of the city, and in 1894 was chosen to the office of mayor. His 
administration won him favorable comment, for it was characterized by 
accuracy and reform along many lines. He has frequently been a delegate 
to various conventions of his party, and his counsels have been regarded as 
judicious in the interests of his party. Socially he is connected with the 
Knights of Pythias, the Junior Order of American Mechanics and the In- 
dependent Order of Odd Fellows, while his political support is in harmony 
with the doctrines of the Republican party. In all the duties of public and 
private life he has been found faithful, and no confidence reposed in him has 
ever been betrayed. 



CHARLES A. J. JOHNSON. 

One of the popular citizens and early residents of W'ildwood is Charles 
A. J. Johnson, the well known conductor running between Holly Beach and 
Cape May Court House, and among the attaches of the road there is no one 
held in higher regard. He was born in Denmark, September 23, 1848, a 
son of Peter and Hinesa (Snogsburgh) Johnson. His grandfather also lived 
in Denmark, and there Peter Johnson was born on the 19th of April, 181 1. 
He came to the United States in 1854, locating in Salem, New Jersey, where 
he engaged in the baker's business and made his home imtil his death. He 
served in the army of his native land. After coming to the New World he 
gave his political support to the Democracy and attended the Baptist church, 
but held membership in the Lutheran church. He died April 20th, 1879. 
and his wife passed away in 1856. This worthy couple were the parents of 
seven children : John Edward, who married Miss Rhinehart and resides in 
Salem. They have a daughter, Mrs. Lena Davis, and had a son, John, who 
was a member of the Ninth New Jersey Infantry and was shot through the 
neck in a raid at Kingston, North Carolina, dying in a hospital as the result 



COXGRESSIOXAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 569 

of his injuries. Lena, the second of the family, married Harry Hinkle 
and had two children, — Ida and Henry. Her second husband was Heniy 
Klincker, and their children were Henrj", Morris and Julius. The father is 
a gardener and baker. Nicholas, who joined the Union army in the civil 
war, was shot through the head at the battle of Fair Oaks and died soon 
after. He first enlisted for three months' sers'ice, and at the expiration of 
that time returned home, but later he joined the Second Delaware Infantry 
and was serving with the Second Regiment of California Volunteers under 
Colonel Baker when killed. He was only eighteen years of age, and for the 
bravery which he displayed on the field of battle was highly complimented 
by his superior officers. Henrietta is the wife of Charles H. Thompson, a 
printer of New Haven, Connecticut, and they have two children, — Herbert 
and Jennie. Charles is the next of the family. Amelia died in Denmark at 
the age of four years; and the youngest died in infancy. 

Charles A. J. Johnson pursued his education until thirteen years of age 
and was then thrown upon his own resources, since which time he has de- 
pended entirely upon his own efforts. He learned the baker's trade in Salem, 
and in i86g began business on his own account, successfully conducting a 
bakery at that place until 1883, when he entered the employ of the West 
Jersey & Seashore Railroad. He worked at the station in Salem and later 
became brakeman on the trains running between Salem and Elmer. Sub- 
sequently he was baggage-master between Salem and Camden, and in 1886 
was promoted as conductor, running between Ocean City and Sea Isle 
Junction, New Jersey. In 1888 he was transferred to his present position 
and has since been a conductor on the line between Holly Beach and Cape 
May Court, House. He is very popular with the patrons of the road, his 
cheerfully rendered assistance and uniform courtesy winning him high 
regard. 

On the 19th of December, 1869, Mr. Johnson was united in marriage 
to Miss Sarah Flannigan, a daughter of James Flannigan, of Salem county, 
and they have five children: Charles Herbert, a druggist now eighteen years 
of age; Howard, who died at the age of six years; Florence and Julius, 
who are also deceased; and Henry, who died in infancy. Mr. and Airs. 
Johnson reside in a beautiful and tastefully furnished residence in Wild- 
wood and are numbered among the oldest residents of the place, so that 
they have a wide acquaintance there. Mr. Johnson belongs to the Cape 
Isle Lodge, No. 30, F. & A. AL. and the Richmond Chapter, No. 22, 
R. A. M., of Millville. He is also a member of the American Order of 
United Workmen, and of the Baptist church, of which he has seiwed as 
clerk and deacon. His life has been an upright and honorable one. char-

believes are calculated to prove a public benefit. 



FRANCIS R. FITHIAN. 



One of the well known financiers of southern New Jersey is Francis 
R. Fithian, and to his own ability, energy and careful management he 
owes the proud position which he now occupies in financial circles. He 
was born in Bridgeton, Cumberland county, May 23, 1855, a son of Charles 
S. and Harriet (Reeves) Fithian, both of whom were representatives of 
old and prominent families of Cumberland county. A member of the 
Fithian family was Dr. Enoch Fithian, a well known historian and physi- 
cian of Greenwich, who lived to be one hundred and one years old. An- 
other of the name who won distinction was Reuben Fithian, state sena- 
tor. Among the maternal relatives were Rev. Dr. Henry Reeves, an 
eminent clergyman of New Jersey, and Francis B. Reeves, the president 
of the Girard National Bank of Philadelphia. All these mentioned were 
uncles or great-uncles of our subject. The Fithian family is of English 
lineage and was founded by a follower of Cromwell in Connecticut at 
about the time of Cromwell's death. About two hundred years ago rep- 
resentatives of the name settled in Cumberland county. New Jersey. One 
of the early members of the family was Rev. Dr. Phillip Vicers Fithian, 
who led. the Revolutionary American citizens that burned the British tea 
at Greenwich at about the same time that the Boston tea party occurred. 
His company dressed as Indians, and the aft'air was hardly less important 
than the event which occurred at Boston. Charles S. Fithian, the father 
of our subject, is still living and is a well known financier of southern New 
Jersey. He is the treasurer of the Cumberland Mutual Fire Insurance 
Compan}-, with which he has been connected for over a quarter of a centu- 
ry, and is a director of the Cumberland National Bank of Bridgeton, New 
Jersey. Half a century ago he established the first building association 
formed in South Jerse}- and has been interested in building associations 
since that time. He is regarded as one of the leading men of southern 
New Jersey, and his influence in business aff^airs in this part of the state 
has been very pronounced. 

Francis R. Fithian, whose name introduces this record, is a graduate 
of the West Jersey Academy at Bridgeton. After completing his school 
course, he was for several years editor and proprietor of the Bridgeton 
Chronicle and other periodicals. In 1888 his father's real estate inter- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 571 

ests demanded so much of his time that he sold his pubhcation in order to 
give his entire attention to the development of Lake View, a suburb of 
Bridgeton, and through his efforts that section of the city was greatly 
improved and beautified. In 1891, in connection with twenty of the prom- 
inent men of the state, he organized the State Mutual Building & Loan 
Association of New Jersey, with offices at Camden. This association 
is now not only the largest in the state but one of the six largest in the 
United States. In 1896 Air. Fithian visited London in order to study 
the methods of the extensive building associations in England, and gained 
there several valuable ideas which have been successfully incorporated into 
the State Mutual Association. This business enterprise, the State Mutual 
Association, is a large savings bank for the people of New Jersey, and 
has assets amounting to two million dollars. In 1896 several building 
and loan officials of the state organized the Building & Loan Mutual Life 
Insurance Company, with a paid-up capital of twenty-five thousand dol- 
lars, and elected Mr. Fithian its president. He is the president of the 
Security Trust Company of Camden, and in 1899, on its organization, 
was elected the president of the Real Estate Loan & Trust Company of 
Camden. He has been one of the active members of the Bridgeton Board 
of Trade, and has been connected with various financial enterprises which 
have not only contributed to his individual prosperity but have also proven 
of great benefit to this portion of the commonwealth. In 1893 he was 
appointed by the governor of New Jersey to represent the state in the 
World's Real Estate Congress, held in Chicago, accessory to the \\'orld's 
Columbian Exposition. — a fact which indicates his standing as a represen- 
tative of the business interests of New Jersey. 

Mr. Fithian was united in marriage to Miss Mary E. D. Hill, a daugh- 
ter of Rev. Dr. Charles E. Hill, a well known clergyman of the New Jer- 
sey Methodist Episcopal conference. They now have an interesting fam- 
ily of four children : Esther Hill, Charles Seeley, Mary Hill and Harriet 
Reeves. Mr. and Mrs. Fithian hold membership in the Presbyterian church. 
In politics he is a Republican, has served in the city board of education in 
Bridgeton and is now one of the trustees of the West Jersey Academy. 
He has always been prominent in public affairs and no one has been more 
actively or commendably interested in the welfare and development of 
this section of the state. He is a man of enterprise, very positive char- 
acter, indomitable energy, strict integrity and liberal views, and has been 
fully identified with the growth and prosperity of New Jersey through the 
years of his manhood. In business he has persevered in the pursuit of a 
persistent purpose and has gained a satisfactory reward. 



572 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

W. J. ADAMSON. 

\V. J. Adamson, who is engaged in the real-estate and insurance business 
in Paulsboro, was born in the town which is still his home, December 31, 
1853. His father, Oram Adamson, was a native of Scotland and came to the 
United States in 1850, hoping to better his financial condition in the New 
World. The ancestry of the family can be traced back to the sixth century, 
and through many generations the Adamsons have been owners and opera- 
tors of woolen mills, engaged in the manufacture of Paisley shawls. 

On crossing the Atlantic the father went to Chicago, Illinois, which was 
then a small town, but in 185 1 came to Paulsboro, New Jersey, where he 
followed his trade of carpet-weaving. He was at one time a soldier in the 
English army and during his life he traveled extensively, both in Europe and 
in America. He wedded Mary Price, a daughter of James Price, of Ireland, 
and they became the parents of seven children, as follows: Mary, the wife 
of W. H. Flower, of Billingsport, New Jersey; W. J., of this sketch; Henry, 
who is living in Paulsboro; Oram, of Denver, Colorado; Isabella,, at home; 
Jemima, the wife of Charles Henry, of Paulsboro; and George, a resident 
of Colorado. The father of these children held membership in the Episco- 
palian church an.d for a number of years served as a warden. He was a very 
genial gentleman, well liked by all who knew him, and his death, which 
occurred in 1876, was mourned by many friends throughout the community. 
He and his son, W. J., were one day out fishing, when the boat capsized and 
they were thrown into the river. They managed to get on the boat, which 
was then drifting bottom side up, and remained there all night, the son hold- 
ing the father on most of the time. At length, however, the elder man 
slipped again into the water and was drowned ! His widow is still living 
and has reached the age of seventy-four years. 

In his early life W. J. Adamson worked upon a farm by the day, but 
determining to abandon agricultural pursuits he began doing carpenter 
work, although he had no previous knowledge of the trade. Soon, however, 
he adapted himself to the new labor and at length became an expert work- 
man. In 1884 he began building residences upon a new addition which 
had been made to Paulsboro, and since that time he has erected one hun- 
dred and thirty-five houses, of which he has sold all but thirty. This is one 
of the attractive additions to the town and stands as a monument to the 
skill and enterprise of Mr. Adamson. He aided in organizing the Billings- 
port & Paulsboro Improvement Company, was made its secretary and still 
holds that position. He is now successfully engaged in the real-estate and 
insurance business, receiving a liberal patronage in both lines. He has been 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 573 

the secretary of the Paulsboro Building & Loan Association, and has long 
been an important factor in the upbuilding and improvement of the town. 

Mrs. Adamson was in her maidenhood Miss Mary Clement, a daughter 
of William Clement, and was of English descent. Unto our subject and his 
wife have been born two children, — Alice and Austin. Socially Mr. Adam- 
son is an Odd Fellow, and has attained the thirty-second degree in the 
Scottish-rite branch of Masonry. In 1894 he was elected the county treas- 
urer of Gloucester county for a term of two years. He takes an active and 
zealous interest in politics and his labors have resulted in advancing the 
interests of the Republican party, whose principles he stanchly supports. 
For twenty years he has been in poor health, having never enjoyed perfect 
health since the night when he and his father were capsized in the river. 
Working thus under disadvantages, he has nevertheless steadily advanced 
to success, and has won a place among the leading representatives of com- 
mercial interests in Paulsboro, at the same time gaining a comfortable 
competence by means of his energy, sound judgment and laudable ambition. 



FRANK E. SMITH. 



No name is more inseparably interwoven with the development, progress 
and upbuilding of Holly Beach than that of Frank Edward Smith, who is 
now serving as the mayor and who is connected with some of the leading 
business interests of the place. Prosperity is due to commercial activity 
and the man who inaugurates and conducts successful business enterprises 
is therefore one of the benefactors of the town and well deserves mention 
among the representative citizens. Such a man is Mr. Smith, and, both 
widely and favorably known throughout the community, he well deserves 
mention in this volume. 

A native of Pennsylvania, he was born in Meadville, Crawford county, 
that state, August 25, 1862, his parents being Oscar B. and Marietta (Kil- 
mer) Smith. The family removed from Lowell, Massachusetts, to the Key- 
stone state. Nelson Smith, the grandfather, was born in Lowell and went 
to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he engaged in farming. He died in 1881, 
at the advanced age of eighty-five years, and his wife passed away when 
eighty-three years of age. They were the parents of four children : Leonard, 
who spent some time in southern California, but is now a cattle-raiser of 
Walla Walla, Washington ; Marion, who entered the Union army during the 
civil war and died in Libby prison; Cortez. a farmer, residing in Meadville, 
Pennsylvania; and Delett, who married Jefl'erson Line. 



574 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

Oscar B. Smith was born in Massachusetts in 1836 and during his boy- 
hood accompanied his parents to Pennsylvania, where he later engaged in 
farming and merchandising. He now makes his home at H0II3' Beach, 
where he has resided since 1884. At present he is engaged in the dairy busi- 
ness. In politics he is a stalwart Republican, and has served as a member of 
the city council of Holly Beach. For three months he was in the civil war, 
but before being ordered to the front hostilities ceased. He married Miss 
Kilmer, and to them have been born seven children : General, who died at 
the age of eighteen months; Frank Eugene, who died at the age of nineteen 
years; Sarah May, the wife of Addison Rose Smith, formerly a grocer of 
Meadville, Pennsyh-ania, but now living near Buffalo; George Nelson, who 
married Blanche Lewis, of Chicago, and is engaged in the nursery business 
in Rochester, New York, exporting his nursery goods to South America; 
Leavitt Sherburn, who is engaged in the dairy business; Oscar, who is 
engaged in bookkeeping for his brother, Frank E. ; and Lester, now sixteen 
years of age, at home with his parents. 

Between the ages of six and fourteen years Frank Edward Smith pur- 
sued his education in the public schools and then began to learn the black- 
smith's trade, which he followed for eight years. He then engaged in the 
butchering business four years, since which time he has been engaged in 
building sea walls. He came to Holly Beach in 1883, and during the years 
which have since passed has taken many contracts for that important work. 
He is particularly skillful in this department of labor, and his works have 
withstood the force of wind and wave in a manner that has gained him high 
commendation. 

His efforts, however, have not been confined alone to this line of in- 
dustry. In 1892 he built an ice plant of ten tons' capacity for the manufac- 
ture of artificial ice, and now has two wagons in use in delivering this cooling 
product to his many patrons at Holly Beach. The plant was erected at a 
cost of thirty thousand dollars, and in connection with its operation he 
freezes fish for the winter and Lenten seasons in Philadelphia. He has the 
only refrigerator of the kind found east of Buffalo, New York, and his pat- 
ronage in this branch of his business is large and constantly increasing. He 
is also engaged in contracting and building, and has erected the Dayton 
Hotel at Wildwood, in addition to many of the beautiful cottages at that 
place and in Holly Beach. 

Almost from its inception Mr. Smith has been actively identified with the 
growth and development of the latter place. The first house built here was 
in 1881, — the property of Joseph Taylor, an officer in the Holly Beach 
Improvement Company. Among the pioneers of the town were Lattimer 




2/. ?//. c. J*: ^u,ic/,„ff, Satcm, '^.y. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 575 

Baker, Joseph Taylor, Dr. Aaron C. Anderson, James Bremmen, Harry 
Bremmen and C. A. Norton. The permanent population of the town is 
four hundred, but in summer there is a population of six thousand and all 
of the hotels are filled, showing this to be one of the most popular resorts 
along the Jersey coast. 

Mr. Smith has been an active factor in the conduct of the government 
of Holly Beach: was assessor in 1885, the year of the incorporation of the 
town, and again in 1887. In 1889, 1890 and 1891 he was a member of the 
city council, and in i8qi was chosen by the council to the position of mayor 
and elected to that office in 1892. Again in 18.94 and 1896 he was elected 
to that office, and in 1898 was elected for a two-years' term, so that he is 
the present incumbent. He does all in his power to promote the growth 
and advance the welfare of Holly Beach, and his administration has been 
progressive and beneficial. He votes with the Democracy and keeps well 
informed on the issues of the day. He was also at one time actively inter- 
ested in the military affairs of the state, and for five years, from 1879 until 
1884, was a member of Company K, Sixth Regiment of New Jersey National 
Guard. 

On the i6th of Jr.ne. 1891, Mr. Smith was united in marriage to Miss 
Matilda Miller, a daughter of Robert Miller, a farmer of Vineland, New 
Jersey. They have a daughter, Frances Matilda, and in Holly Beach they 
are widely and favorably known. Mr. Smith is recognized as one pi the 
most able business men of the town, his diligence, indomitable energy and 
undaunted perseverance winning him prosperity that numbers him among 
the substantial citizens. He has done much toward promoting the general 
welfare by promoting trade and commerce, and by the wise judgment which 
he has displayed in tlie discharge of his official duties. His career, both 
public and private, has been marked by the strictest integrity and faithful- 
ness to every trust reposed in him. 



THE YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. 

In the moral development and welfare of Salem there has been no more 
important factor than the Young Men's Christian Association, which since 
its organization has exerted a wide influence for good. Its effect is immeas- 
urable, being like the "echoes which roll from soul to soul and live forever 
and forever." For a number of years the association occupied rented rooms 
on East Broadway and the directors secured William W. Barker to act as 
the general secretary. He held the position for over four years, and on the 



5/6 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

expiration of that period resigned to become the pastor of a Baptist church 
at Phillipsburg, New Jersey. He was succeeded by Harrj" Dare, who after 
about two years' ser\-ice also resigned and became the pastor of a Baptist 
church at Junction, Xew Jersey. By this time the association spirit had 
spread to such an extent and the membership had grown to such proportions 
that it was necessary- to have a home of its own, and steps were taken toward 
the erection of a building. In 1894 a deposit of iifteen thousand dollars was 
made and the building was erected. ^\^ G. Tyler gave five thousand dollars 
to the btiilding and the citizens of Salem raised the remainder. 

John A. Warner became the first secretary in the new building and re- 
mained in that position until January, 1898. He was succeeded by W. G. 
Cartlich, who, however, served for only eight months. The present secretarA", 
William H. Pullen.came to the association on the ist of October, 1898. and 
has since remained in charge. The present membership is one hundred and 
fifty in the senior department and fiitj- in the junior department Religious 
services, Bible and educational classes and entertainments are held regularly 
and thus the work is carried forward, a place being provided for young men 
where they may have healthful and helpful entertainment that will be a ben- 
efit to their physical and moral natures. The association was never so pros- 
perous as at the present time, and Salem may well be proud of the work 
that is being done thereby. 



HENRY T. WEST. 



Henry J. AVest, one of the most highly esteemed citizens of Gloucester 
city. Camden county, Xe\\- Jersey, now sennng as a member of the state 
board of taxation, was bom April i, 1850. in Allendale. Rhode Island. He 
comes of distinguished Xew England stock, among the descendants of his 
paternal ancestors being Lieutenant Governor West, of that state. Mr. 
West's grandfather. Job R. West, was a lifelong resident of Rhode Island, 
where he was engaged as a millwright during his years of actiAit^'. 

Henn,- F. West, the father of Henn,- J., was a native of Rhode Island, 
being one of the two children bom to his parents. He worked in the mills 
in that state until after his marriage, becoming familiar with the details 
in each department. In 1857 he came to Gloucester city, accepting the 
position of manager of the Washington Mills, the largest mills of this local- 
it}-, which then employed some six hundred hands, the force in course of 
time increasing to twelve hundred hands. At the end of thirty- 
five years of ser\-ice in this responsible position he resigned, thenceforward 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 577 

living in retirement until his death, at the age of sixty-three years. Henry 
F. West was a man of great intelhgence and influence, everywhere respected 
for his strict integrity. He served as a meml:)er of the city council, being 
its president for many years, and was also the president of the board of 
education a number of terms. In politics he was a sound Republican, and 
in religion was a valued member of the Presbyterian church and took an ac- 
tive interest in the denominational work. His wife, formerly Zeviah Walker, 
was born in Scituate, Rhode Island, a daughter of George G. and Sarah 
(Mathewson) Walker. She now makes her home with her son, Henry J.

Mills, becoming an apprentice in the machine shop, and afterward being 
employed in the other departments until conversant with the work of each, 
when he was appointed assistant to his father in the management of the 
mills. Retiring from this position in 1885, he was appointed under-sheriff 
by Sheriff Baird in 1887. and remained in this office until 1890, when he 
was elected the sheriff of Camden county by the largest majority ever re- 
ceived by a county officer up to that date. He served as sheriff until 1893, 
a period covering the maximum number of years in one term of that office. 
In 1894 Mr. West was nominated by Governor AVerts of New Jersey as a 
member of the state board of taxation for a temi of five years, and his nomi-

RICHARD T. MILLER. 



Richard Thompson Miller, circuit-court judge of New Jersey, is one of 
those who, by reason of their knowledge of the law and their manner of ad- 
ministering it, have placed the judiciary of New Jersey on that high plane 
which it SO' justly occupies. 

Judge Miller's paternal grandfather, Jonas Miller, the only child of 
Abram Miller and his wife Susanna, nee Stanbury, was born in Essex 
county, New Jerse_\-, in 1786, and early in life removed to Bass River, in 
Atlantic county, where he successfully engaged in the business of ship- 
building and chandlery. Some years later he purchased Congress Hall 
and its plantation at Cape Lsland, now Cape May City, and resided there 
during the remainder of his days. He married Mary Mathis, and by this 
union had six children, one of whom. Waters Burroughs Miller, the father 
of the present judge, was for years the proprietor of Congress Hall. His 
rare judgment, sturdy honesty and quick appreciation of the affairs and 
needs of his fellow citizens endeared him alike to all parties; and he was 
chosen to fdl many offices of trust and responsibility. He represented his 
county in the house of assembly in 1853, and in the state senate for two 
terms, from 1880 until 1886. He died in 1892, at the age of sixty-eight 
years. 

Judge Miller's maternal great-great-grandfather, William Williams, of 
Loudoun county, Virginia, a colonel in the Third Regiment of Pennsylvania 
Volunteers, was married on the 24th of July, 1779, at Christ church in the 
city of Philadelphia, to Abigail, a daughter of Richard and Esther Zane 
Collins, of Gloucester county (now Camden county), New J.ersey. Their 
only child, Hetty W., married Captain Humphrey Hughes, who' during 
the war of 18 12 sailed imder letters of marque issued by the French gov- 
ernment and gained considerable fame for his attempt to rescue Bonaparte 
from his imprisonment at St. Helena — an attempt which, but for the pre- 
mature discharge of a weapon caused by the fall of a sailor, would undoubt- 
edly have been successful. One of the children of Captain Hughes was 
Louisa W., the wife of Enoch Edmunds, of Cape May county, who became 
the sheriff of his county and represented it in the state senate of 1850 and 
1853- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 579 

Louisa H. Edmunds, the daughter of Senator Edmunds, married Waters 
B. Miller in January, 1845. She died at the early age of thirty-three years, 
leaving four children, among whom was Richard T. Miller, who was born 
in Cape May county on the i6th of December, 1845. At the age of eight 
he was sent to Meigs Academy at Pottstown, Pennsylvania, where he re- 
mained but a very short time, being placed the next year in the Congre- 
gational School at Easton, Connecticut, where he continued his studies 
for two years. After that he attended the West Jersey Academy at Bridge- 
ton, New Jerse}', until the death of its principal, Professor Thompson, in 
i860. He then began to prepare for Yale College under the instruction ot 
a private tutor; but, being compelled by reason of ill health to abandon his 
purpose of entering college, he joined the engineering corps then at work 
en the new railroad between Millville and Cape May, of which his father. 
Senator Miller, was one of the foremost promoters. Upon the completion 
of his labors as a surveyor he, in September, 1863, registered as a student 
at law under the tutorship of the Hon. Thomas P. Carpenter, late justice of 
the New Jersey supreme court, then practicing in Camden. He was ad- 
mitted to the bar as an attorney at the November term, 1867, and at once 
opened an office at Cape May City, whence about a year later he returned 
to Camden, where he has ever since resided. He was made a counselor 
at law at the November term, 1870, and city solicitor of Cape May City hi 
1869; was the judge of the district court of the city of Camden from March, 
1877, to January, 1888; and prosecutor of the pleas for Cape May county 
in 1889 for a term of five years. The last named office he resigned on 
March 30, 1892, to accept the common-pleas judgeship of Camden; on 
March 11, 1893, to accept the circuit-court judgeship for the state, begin- 
ning at once the duties of an official term ending in March, 1900. On the 
1 2th of the latter month he retired from that office, after serving seven 
years; and April 28 following, by Governor Voorhees, he was appointed a 
member of the board of fish-ground commissioners. 

Judge Miller married, in 1874, Miss Mercedes Ysabel Azcarate, a native 
of Cuba, with whom he became acquainted while she, in company with her 
parents, summered at Cape May. The ceremony took place at Christ 
church, Philadelphia, before the very same altar where just ninety-five 
years previously, his great-great-grandfather. Colonel Williams, wedded 
the Quaker maiden Abigail Collins. 

Judge Miller's ability, natural and acquired, is peculiarly suited to his 
chosen profession, as is shown by the eminence that he has achieved in it. 
Each of the positions for which he has been selected he has filled with credit 
to himself and to those responsible for his appointment; and his elevation 



580 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

to the bench is a fitting cuhiiination, giving full play to his best faculties. 
His impartial judgments have commended him most favorably to that large 
part of the community whose business has brought them in close contact 
with him. The Judge is thoroughly domestic in his habits, is easy in man- 
ner, and has always so willingly aided the younger members of the bar that 
with them he is a universal favorite, while his character and attainments 
have equally commended him to his contemporaries. 



BLOOMFIELD H. MINCH. 

Hon. Bloomfield H. I\'Iinch, of Bridgeton, ex-member of the assembly 
for Cumberland county, was born on a farm in Hopewell township, this 
county. October 10, 1864. He is a son of Francis B. and Elizabeth H. 
(Tice) Minch, and belongs to one of the oldest and best families in the 
Union, native in southern New Jersey for many generations. His great- 
grandfather was Benjamin Minch, and. his grandfather was Archibald 
Minch, a wealthy farmer of Hopewell, his native town, who was very promi- 
nent in the community and active in public affairs. He was the last original 
stockholder of the Cumberland National Bank, which was founded in 1812. 
A strong old Whig, he was the first man in the town to declare allegiance 
to the Republican party. Of his children only Francis B. survives him. 

Francis B. Minch was born on the homestead in Hopewell, August 14, 
1833, and lived there fifty years. He personally superintended his farm, 
which was an extensive one, until 1883, when he came to Bridgeton. He 
v.fas one of the incorporators of the Bridgeton National Bank, of which he 
has been a director for many years; and he is the president of the North 
Bridgeton Land Company, which was organized for the purpose of de- 
veloping North Bridgeton. -While in Hopewell he was a member of the 
board of freeholders of the township. After moving to the city he was 
elected a member of the eity council from the third ward. Mr. Minch is a 
prominent Mason, belonging to Brearly Lodge, No. 2, and Brearly Chap- 
ter, No. 6. His wife, who is a native of Pittsgrove, Salem county, has 
borne him three children, namely: Robert F., who died at the age of 
twenty-three; Bloomfield H., the subject of this sketch; and Mary, the wife 
of E. Freeman Crowell, of Lansdowne, Pa. Both parents are members of 
the First Presbyterian church. 

The Hon. Bloomfield H. Minch attended the common schools of Hope- 
viell, graduated at the South Jersey Listitute in the class of 1883, and 
finished a course of studv at Bryant & Stratton's Business College, Phila- 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 581 

delphia, in May, 1884. In November of that year he formed with Wilham 
O. Garrison a partnership, which still continues. The house of Garrison & 
Minch soon came to be looked upon as one of the most prosperous and re- 
liable in the city of Bridgeton. They deal in all kinds of farm implements 
and agricultural produce, and are extensively engaged in the manufacture 
of fertilizers. They have the most extensive business of the kind in south 
Jersey and give employment to from fifty to one hundred persons. Mr. 
Minch is a thorough business man. He was one of the incorporators 
and is now the treasurer of the Cumberland Construction Company, of 
which Mr. Garrison is the president. The corporation, which makes a 
specialty of bridge and wharf building, has satisfactorily executed many 
heavy contracts. Mr. Minch was also one of the organizers and incorpora- 
tors of the Cumberland Trust Company, of Bridgeton; also one of the incor- 
porators and a director of the State Mutual Life Insurance Company, of 
Cam.den, and also of the Real Estate Loan & Trust Company, of Camden. 

On December 30, 1886, he was married to Miss Mary E. Rebeau, of 
Camden. Two children have blessed the union, — Robert F. and Aleta E. 
Mrs. Minch died January 2, 1896. 

In politics Mr. Minch has been prominent as a Republican for some 
time, and has been elected several times as a delegate to state conventions. 
In 1894 he was elected to the legislature by a large majority, and served on 
the committees on banks and insurance and stationery, and the joint com- 
mittee on federal relations. In the fall of 1895 ^^ was re-elected for the 
term of 1896-7. He is a past master of Brearly Lodge, No. 2, A. F. & A. 
M., past high priest of Brearly Chapter, No. 6; a member of Olivet Com- 
mandery, No. 10; and he has been three times a representative of the grand 
lodge of the state. He also belongs to Cohansey Lodge. No. 103, Inde- 
pendent Order of Odd Fellows, and to the Junior Order of American Me- 
chanics. Both he and Mrs. Minch are members of the First Presbyterian 
church. They have a beautiful home on ^^'est Commercial street, which 
Mr. Mincli has built since his marriage. 



THE CASPER FAMILY. 

One of the old and distinguished families of New Jersey is the Casper 
family, that for several generations has been connected with Salem county. 
Lawrence Casper, the first of the name in America, was a native of Baden 
Baden, Germanv, and leaving the fatherland he came to the new world 
with the Wistars. the IMotts. the Oaks. Hitchners, Frieses and others. By 



582 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

trade he was a hatter and followed that pursuit in Cohansey, where he made 
his home for many years. He was a member of the Lutheran church. He 
had two children, — Lawrence and John. The latter, the grandfather of 
our subject, also learned the hatter's trade. In 1898 he removed to Sharp- 
town, New Jersey, where he followed his chosen occupation and also carried 
on agricultural pursuits. Through many long years he served as con- 
stable and proved a most efficient and faithful officer. His political sup- 
port was given first to the Whig party and afterward to the Democracy. 
He died in 1852, at the age of seventy-six years, and the community lost 
thereby one of its valued citizens. He was twice married, his first union 
being with Hannah Wentzel, and Sarah Bilderback became his second wife. 

Thomas Jefiferson Casper, the father of our subject, was a child of the 
first marriage, and was born in Sharptown, in 1802. He spent his minority 
there and after attaining to man's estate he was married and removed to 
Mannington township, Salem county, where he carried on farming until 
his death. He took an active part in public affairs and like his father 
served throughout a long period as constable. He also held the office of 
sheriff and was almost continuously in some position of public trust and 
responsibility. His political support was given the Democracy and he 
was recognized as a leader in the local ranks of the party. He wedded 
Mary Ann Anderson, and they became the parents of ten children, namely : 
William A., John, Joseph, Charles, Thomas J., Hannah W., the wife of 
James Lindsey, Samuel C, Mary, Anna and Ephraim Davis. The father 
died in Trenton, New Jersey, at the age of sixty-six years, and the mother 
passed away when eighty-two years of age. 

William A. Casper, who is now prominently connected with the busmess 
and public interests of Salem county, was born on the old homestead in 
Mannington township, September 30, 1828, and obtained his education in 
the district schools of the neighborhood. He early became familiar with 
all the duties and labors that fall to the lot of the agriculturist and after 
attaining his majority followed farming on his own account until i860, 
when he began dealing in grain and hay in Salem. He followed that 
business for some time and then turned his attention to auctioneering, 
which he has since followed with excellent success. His ability to manage 
a sale has made him very popular in his line, and his services are in demand 
over a wide area. He is also the owner of two valuable farms, one located 
in Quinton township, the other in Lower Penn's Neck township, and these 
add materially to his income. 

In February, 1850, was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Casper and Miss 
Elizabeth Stretch, a daughter of Mark Stretch, and to them were born 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 583 

ei-ht children— Hildreth, who has been twice married; .WilUam J.; Anna: 
Eriza1)eth S.; John; Mary; Anna, and one who died in infancy. The mother 
was called to her eternal home in 1898, at the age of sixty-eight years 

Like others of his family, Mr. Casper has been officially connected with 
the keeping of the public peace, having served as sheriff of Salein county 
from t86o until 1863. He has also held a number of township offices. He 
is independent in politics, supporting those whom he thinks best qualified 
for office, regardless of party affiliations. Energy and enterprise are num- 
bered among his chief characteristics and have been the most important 
factors in his success. In manner he is social and genial, and he has a host 
of warm friends. He is a worthy representative of a family that since 
colonial days has been connected with the county and that has always been 
loyal and faithful to its best interests. 



DAVID WILEY, M. D. 



One of the leading phvsicians and extensive land-owners of Salem is 
Dr Wilev whose marked executive ability, keen discernmentandunflagguig 
enterpris;'have gained him prestige in both professional and commercia 
circles He is one of Salem county's nath-e sons, his birth having occurred 
in Upper Penn's Neck, Mav 8, 1848, and his parents being Joseph B. and 
Mary Amanda (Morris) Wiley. His grandfather, David Wiley, was a sou 
of John Wiley, and the family name is of Swedish origin. Its representa- 
tives were earlv members of the Swedenborgian church, but afterward be- 
came identified with the Protestant Episcopal church. David Wiley, the 
grandfather, was a native of Upper Penn's Neck, made farming his life 
work, and died in Penn's Grove. He was also a director m the Salem 
National Bank, and was honored by his fellow townsmen with an election 
to the state legislature. His religious views were in harmony with the 
doctrine of the Episcopalian church, of which he was accordingly a mem- 
ber He married Lydia Borden and they became the parents of John, 
Rebecca, Harriet, George, Uriah,. Jane, Joseph B. and Elijah, and one who 
died in infancy. The grandfather of the Doctor died in October, 1856, at 
the age of sixtv-seven vears. 

Joseph B Wilev, the Doctor's father, was born in Upper Penn s Neck 
township, Salem "county, in 1822, and when he had attained to 
man's estate began farming there. He was the owner of one hun- 
dred and seventv acres of rich land, which he placed under a high state 
of cultivation, the well tilled fields yielding to him a golden tribute m re- 



584 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

turn for liis care and labor. He married Mary Amanda Morris, and thev 
became the parents of four children — David; William, who was born in 
April, 1850, and died at the age of nine years; Elizabeth, who was born in 
1852, and died at the age of twenty-one years; and Joseph, a resident of 
Salem, who was born in October, 1855, and married Emma T. Dallas. The 
father died in 1855. at the early age of thirty-three years, and the mother 
long survived him, passing away in 1893, at the age of sixty-nine years. 

In his youth Dr. Wiley attended the public schools of Woodston, later 
was a student in Pennington Seminary and the Michigan State Univer- 
sity, and was graduated at the University of Pennsylvania, in 1869, with 
the degree of M. D. He had determined to make the practice of medicine 
his Hfe work, and after careful and thorough preparation for his chosen 
profession he located in Salem in 1870, and opened an office. He is a 
representative of "regular" medicine, and in his practice he has met with 
excellent success and won distinction as a leading physician of the com- 
munity. 

He is also a man of excellent business and executive ability and splendid 
powers of management, and is thereby enabled successfully to control ex- 
tensive landed interests. His property holdings are very valuable. He and 
his brother, Joseph B., own a farm in Gloucester county of one hundred 
acres, and he has one hundred acres in Olden township, Salem county; one 
hundred and fifty acres in Upper Penn's Neck township; a second one in 
that township of three hundred and fifteen acres; two hundred and twenty- 
five acres in Mannington township; two farms in Elsinboro township, com- 
prising four hundred acres; and one in Cumberland county of one hundred 
and twenty acres. In addition to this he has charge of the estates of John 
H. and Josiah Morris. The former comprises two farms in Mannington 
township, one of two hundred and twenty-five acres, the other of one hun- 
dred and thirty acres; one in Gloucester county; and one in West Virginia 
of two hundred and sixty-five acres, besides business property, houses and 
money. The estate of Joseph Morris represents two farms, besides mon- 
eyed interests. Although his business cares in the management of these 
properties are extensive, his efforts are not confined to them alone, for he is 
connected with banking enterprises and is a member of the Building & Loan 
Association. 

In his political afffliations the Doctor is a Republican and keeps well 
informed on the issues of the day, but has never sought political preferment, 
having never served in public office save as a member of the board of 
health. He holds membership in the Methodist Episcopal church and at 
one time was a member of its board of trustees. His life has been well 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 585 

spent and his fidelity to duty has ever been most marked. The salient 
points in his career are unfaltering perseverance and unflag-ging enterprise 
in business, loyalty in social life and reliability in public trusts, — qualities 
which have gained to him the high regard of many friends. 



GEORGE W. REED. 



One of the foremost men in railroad circles in Woodbury is George W. 
Reed, whose long experience and efficient service renders him an authority 
in his line. His parents came of two of the oldest and most highly respected 
families of Gloucester county, and his relatives are numbered among the 
representative citizens of this section of the state. 

The Reeds, or Reads (as the name was spelled originally), are of English 
extraction. Esquire Joseph Reed, the grandfather of our subject, was born 
and spent the major portion of his life in Gloucester county. New Jersey. He 
was a well-known and respected citizen, a magistrate, and a local preacher 
in the Methodist Episcopal church. He died about 1856, and of his entire 
family only one member, James, survives, as the wife and mother. Alary 
Reed, and three of their sons — Thomas B., William B. and Joseph L., — 
are deceased. 

William B., the father of G. W. Reed, was born in this county, February 
20, 1822, and spent his early years upon a farm. He acquired a fair educa- 
tion and for several years was a successful teacher in the schools of his 
native county. In 1857 he removed to Philadelphia, where he died Febru- 
an»' 9, 1859, then in his prime. His wife. Eliza (Thompson) Reed, lived 
many years longer, being summoned to the silent land, at Paulsboro, Xew 
Jersey, in September, 1886. Of their children, Sarah T. and Wilmer are 
deceased, and John C. is a resident of Woodstown, New Jersey. Airs. 
Reed was a granddaughter of Isaac Thompson, a soldier of the Revolution, 
during which war his home was at Thompson's Point, a place named in his 
honor. His son Nathan, the father of Mrs. Reed, was born and passed his 
entire life in this county. Pie died about 1865, loved and mourned by a 
large circle of life-long friends. He maiTied Sarah Russell and had ten 
children — James R., Samuel, Richard, Uriah, George, Ann, Rebecca, Eliza, 
and twO' who died when young. 

George W^ Reed was born near Bridgeport, Logan township, Glouces- 
ter county. April 18, 1S46, and received his primary education in the schools 
taught by his father. Later he pursued his studies in private schools and in 
the Hancock grammar school in Philadelphia. Having a desire to equip 



586 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

himself for the battle of life in some special manner, he next learned tel- 
egraphy in the Quaker Business College in Philadelphia. During the civil 
war he was in the employ of the government for two years as a fireman on 
trains of the West Jersey Railroad, which transported soldiers and supplies 
to the Union army in the south. In 1866 Mr. Reed took a position as tele- 
graph operator for the road just mentioned and at the end of three years 
was appointed station agent at Swedesboro, New Jersey. In 1875 he was 
transferred to a similar position at Millville, New Jersey, remaining there 
until October, 1878, when he resigned, in order to accept a better place in 
the service of Lippincott Sons & Company, wholesale auctioneers of Phila- 
delphia. After four years with that firm he became the auditor and general 
passenger agent of the Delaware River Railroad, entering upon his re- 
sponsible duties on the ist of October, tSSi. Eighteen years have rolled 
away, and he still continues in this position, having thoroughly proved his 
value to the company. He takes a lively interest in the affairs of the com- 
munity in which he dwells, and plays the part of a true patriot. He served 
his friends and neighbors as assessor of Greenwich township one year, and 
was clerk of the board of freeholders of Woodbury three years. In his 
political views he is a Democrat. 

The family relations of Mr. Reed have always been verv^ happy. He 
was united in marriage with Miss Susan Adams, daughter of John B. and 
Susan Adams, of Philadelphia, in June. 1868. Their union was blessed 
with four children, two of whom have been summoned to the better land. 
Wilber, the eldest, married Haddie Colins, of Pleasantville, New Jersey. 
Clifton, the second son, who had wedded Emma B. Walker, of Clarksboro, 
New Jersey, died in January, 1899, at the age of twenty-eight years. How- 
ard H. married Annie Hammil, of Marlton, New Jersey. Charles A., the 
youngest, died when but twelve years of age. 



ALEXANDER R. FITHIAN. 

The name of Fithian has been so long prominently and honorably con- 
nected with the history of southern New Jersey that Alexander Robeson 
Fithian needs no special introduction to the readers of this volume. He 
has himself been for a number of years recognized as a very important 
factor in social and political circles. His parents are Charles S. and Harrier 
(Reeves) Fithian. He was born in Bridgeton, New Jersey, in 1863, and 
has two brothers, — ^William S., a merchant of Bridgeton, and Francis R.. 
who is prominently connected with building- and loan associations of this 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 587 

state. He attended the West Jersey Academy and the South Jersey Insti- 
tute, being a graduate of the latter institution. Determining to make the 
practice of law his life work, he then entered the Columbia College of New 
York, and is a graduate of that institution. He has become a well-known 
Republican leader in South Jersey, yet has never been a politician in the 
sense of an office-seeker, having never except on one occasion held public 
ofifice. His influence and efforts, however, have proven a strong factor in 
electing many state, county and city officials. He was appointed by Presi- 
dent Harrison to the office of collector of customs, but on no other occa- 
sion has he accepted official reward for his political service. His fitness for 
leadership in political life is widely recognized because of his comprehen- 
sive and accurate knowledge of the political situation of the country, the 
needs of the people, of public opinion and his marked ability to guide and 
direct public thought and action. In literary circles he is not less promi- 
nent. He has one of the most valuable libraries in Bridgeton and is an 
acknowledged authority on most literary questions. In connection with 
his brother, Francis R. Fithian, he is extensively interested in financial and 
real-estate matters, including National Park, a pleasure resort in town 
situated on the east bank of the Delaware, a few miles below Camden. It 
is there that the monument which marks the battle-ground of Red Bank 
is to be seen, as well as the trenches which were used by the soldiers in 
the Revolutionary war. Mr. Fithian is a director in several financial, in- 
surance and other institutions of South Jersey and is a member of the Bar 
Association of both Cumberland and Camden counties. The Bridgeton 
Hospital was made possible by his exertions, about two years ago, and 
under his direction as its president is becoming a necessary part of Cum- 
berland county's advance. 



EDGAR F. DELL. 



In the business affairs of life and now in public office Edgar F. Dell has 
manifested marked executive ability and keen discrimination. For a num- 
ber of years he was connected with the commercial interests of Philadel- 
phia and of Baltimore, and at the present writing he is capably discharging 
the duties of postmaster of Woodbury, where his courtesy to the patrons 
of the office and his promptness and fidelity in administering its aft'airs have 
won him the regard and commendation of the public. 

Mr. Dell is a native of Philadelphia, his birth having occurred in that 



588 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

city, on the 8th of June, 1852. Back to "merrie England" the ancestry of 
the family is traced. Tlie grandfather, Richard Dell, and the father of our 
subject, Joseph F. Dell, were both natives of Belvidere, Warren county. 
New Jersey. The latter entered upon his business career as a clerk in 
his native town, and later secured a clerical position in a clothing store in 
Philadelphia. Subsequently he began business on his own account as a 
member of the firm of Becker & Dell, which was one of the oldest clothing 
firms in that city. The house sustained a very enviable reputation and in 
consequence enjoyed a liberal patronage. In 1871 he removed to Wood- 
bury, where he made his home, although he conducted his business in- 
terests in Philadelphia. He was a great lover of horses, and usually owned 
some fine specimens of the noble steed. He married Miss Kate Clute, and 
they became the parents of seven children, namely : Edgar F. ; Walter, who 
is living in the west; Frank, a resident of Philadelphia; Josephine, the 
wife of William Gristearn, who makes his home abroad; Richard, also of 
Philadelphia; Annie, the wife of West Jessup, of Woodbury; and Jean- 
nette, the wife of Arthur Star. The father of these children died in 1885, 
but the mother is still living, at the age of sixty-four years. 

Edgar F. Dell spent his boyhood days in his native city and is indebtea 
to its public-school system for the educational privileges which he received. 
On putting aside his text-books he entered his father's clothing store and 
thoroughly mastered the business, remaining with the firm of Becker & 
Dell until his father's retirement from business in 1884. He then became a 
traveling salesman for a Baltimore house, which he represented upon the 
road for twelve years. With his father's family he had taken up his abode 
in Woodbury, and during President Cleveland's first administration he was 
appointed postmaster, which position he filled until retired during President 
Harrison's term of office. When Grover Cleveland was again elected he 
was once more appointed to the position, and most capably and efficiently 
administered the affairs of the office. He has always been a stalwart Dem- 
ocrat in his political affiliations and has given an earnest and loyal support 
to the party. 

In 1872 I\Ir. Dell was united in marriage to Miss Sarah, daughter of 
Judge William D. Scott of Woodbury. Their union has been blessed with 
six children, namely: Edgar, Alice S., Clarence, Marion, Joseph S. and 
Frank P. The family is one of prominence in the community, holding a 
position of relative distinction in social circles. Air. Dell still retains an 

interest in a wholesale clothing house in , but maintains his 

residence in Woodbury, where he has a wide acquaintance. His reliability 
in business affairs, his fidelity to duty in public office, his genial manner and

uniform courtesy in social circles, all gain for him the regard and confidence 
of those with whom he comes in contact. 



GEORGE RUMSEY. 



The true measure of individual success is determined by what one has 
accomplished: and, when we know that Richard Rumsey has worked his 
way upward from a humble position to a place among the most substantial- 
citizens of Salem, we cannot but acknowledge that his success has been 
most creditable and enviable. Fate does not bestow her favors promiscu- 
ously. Thev must be earnestly sought after and perseverance and energy 
must characterize the search. These elements, dominating the businss ca- 
reer of Mr. Rumsey, have brought him prosperity and now enable him to 
lay aside the more active duties of life and live practically retired. 

' A son of Charles and Hannah (Mulford) Rumsey, he was born in Salem, 
April 22, 1833. His father was a native of Maryland and became a mer- 
chant and silversmith of Salem. He was a member of the Methodist church, 
and his life was an honorable and upright one. but his career was brought 
to an untimely termination, for he died in early manhood, on the 14th of 
September, 1841. By his marriage to Hannah Mulford he had five chil- 
dren : Jacob T^Iulford, who followed merchandising first at Salem and after- 
ward in Portsmouth, Ohio, married Mar)^ Stanger and had two children, 
Edward S. and Laura. Charles, who engaged in merchandising in Salem 
and in Philadelphia, wedded Emma Micher, a sister of John Micher, of 
Philadelphia, and they had two children,— Gertrude and Anna, and by his 
second wife, whose maiden name was Marie Sovereign, he also reared a 
number of children. James M., a merchant of Portsmouth, Ohio, married 
Miss Harriet GosteiT, and their children are John C, Charles C, Eliza W., 
James M., William T., Blasphel and Hattie. Hannah AL, is the wife of S. L. 
J Miller,' a retired farmer, and has one child, Wyatt W. George is the 
youngest of the family. The mother died November 2. 188 1. at the ad- 
vanced age of eightv-seven years. 

During the greater part of his life George Rumsey has been a resident 
of Salem, and for many years was a most active factor in its business in- 
terests. Having arrived at years of maturity he engaged in merchandising 
here, conducting his store until i860, when he resolved to try his fortune m 
Ohio and removed to Portsmouth, that state, where he opened a whole- 
sale dr>'-goods and notions house. There he carried on operations for eight 
years, building up a good trade and deriving therefrom an excellent income. 
From time to time he made judicious investments in real estate, and since 



590 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

his return to Salem in 1868 he has practically lived retired, only devoting 
his energies to the management of his property in this place and elsewhere. 

In February, 1862, occurred the marriage of Mr. Rumsey and Miss 
Cornelia A. Howard, and to them have been born the following: Walter 
A., who graduated in pharmacy and is now engaged in the drug business 
in Philadelphia, married a lady of Philadelphia. Charles Gifford Havord, 
born in 1865, died in 1S69: Eugene, a graduate of Cornell University, is 
now a member of the firm of the Rumsey Electrical Manufacturers' Com- 
pany, consulting engineers, and manufacturers' agent in Philadelphia; Ann 
Renby is the next of the family; George A. is associated with his brother 
Eugene in business; and Carroll Livingston, who was graduated in June, 
1898, at the Troy (New York) Polytechnic Institute, is now in the employ 
of the Shiffler Bridge Company, as ci\^il engineer, at Pittsburg, Pennsyl- 
vania. 

"A prophet is never without honor save in his own country," and even 
there a very good prophet may have honor. In view of this, there is par- 
ticular interest attaching to the career of the subject of this review, since 
he is a native son of the place where he has passed his entire life and has 
so directed his ability as to gain recognition as one of the representative 
citizens of Salem. The salient points in his life history are sustained indus- 
try, invincible spirit, sturdy loyalty and unwavering honor,' — all of which 
have eventuated most naturally in securing him a position in the respect 
and esteem of his fellow men. 



MAURICE AYRES. 



This gentleman, who is the president of the Ayres Machine Company, 
of Salem, New Jersey, was born in Greenwich, Cumberland county, this 
state, on the 23d of April, 1865. The ancestral history of the family can 
be traced back to James Ayres, the great-grandfather of our subject. Rob- 
ert Ayres, the grandfather, was a machinist, and for many years carried on 
business in Greenwich, continuing operations there until his death. He 
gave his political support to the men and measures of the Republican party, 
and in his religious faith he was a Baptist. He was twice married. He 
wedded a Miss Wood, and they became the parents of five children : Albert, 
James, Benjamin, Elizabeth and Emeline. For his second wife he chose 
Miss Strather, and they had four children : Frank, Charles, Walter and 
David. The father died in November, 1886, when about seventy-five years 
of age. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 591 

The parents of our subject were James and Elizabeth Ayres. The father 
was born in Greenwich, Cumberland county, in 1837, acquired his education 
in the schools of his native town, and after putting aside his text-books 
learned the machinist's trade, which he followed for many years. In 1883 he 
retired from that line of business and has since devoted his energies to the 
canning business. 

Maurice Ayres, whose name introduces this sketch, attended the high 
school of Salem and was graduated in the class of 1881. He then learned the 
machinist's trade with his father, thoroughly mastering the business in 
every detail and 1)ecoming an expert workman. On his father's retirement 
from that business in 1883 he became his successor, in partnership with 
Benjamin F. Tyler, under the firm name of Tyler & Ayres. This connec- 
tion was continued for two years, when he bought out his partner and con- 
tinued the business alone until 1893, when it was incorporated under the 
firm name of the Ayres Machine Company, with the following officers: 
Maurice B. Ayres, president; and Charles H. Ayres, secretary and treas- 
urer. They conduct a general machinist's business and do general repair 
work, but make a specialty of the manufacture of machinery for canning 
factories. Employment is furnished to twenty men and the output of the 
factory is extensive, for the company enjoys an excellent reputation on ac- 
count of the superior grade of their work and also for reliability in all trade 
transactions. The shop is one hundred and fifteen by twenty-eight feet 
and is equipped with all the accessories necessary in the production of first- 
class iron work. The business of the Ayres Machine Company has now 
become one of the leading industries of Salem and its prosperity is due to 
the well directed efforts and business ability of the president. 

On .the 27th of October, 1886, Mr. Ayres married Miss Ella D. Finlow. 
and they now have one child, William F. Their pleasant home is a favorite 
resort with their many friends and they occupy an en\-iable position in the 
social world. 



DR. H. L. GILMOUR. 



One of the successful practicing dentists of Philadelphia and an esteemed 
resident of Wenonah, is the gentleman whose name introduces this review. 
Dentistry may be .said to be almost unique among other occupations, as it is 
at once a profession, a trade and a business. Such being the case, it follows 
that in order to attain the highest success in it one must be thoroughly 
conversant with the theory of the art, must be expert in the use of the many 
tools and appliances incidental to the practice of modern dentistry, and 



592 BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST 

must also have the lousiness qualifications adequate to dealing with the finan- 
cial side of the profession. In all of these regards Dr. Gilmour is well fitted 
for his chosen calling and has gained a position of distinct precedence 
among the representatives of his profession in Philadelphia. 

A native of New Jersey, he was born in Cape May, October 5, 1865, and 
is a son of H. L. Gilmour, whose birth occurred in Londonderry, Ireland, 
and who came to the United States in the year of the Doctor's birth. The 
maternal grandfather of our subject, Captain Howard, was a sea captain 
and broke the chain by which the French tried to blockade the port of Lon- 
donderry in the war between England and France in 1740. The paternal 
grandfather also participated in the same war and fired the first gun at the 
French whereby hostilities were inaugurated. 

The Doctor's father came to the United States with Captain Lake, with 
no intention of taking up his abode here, but began work at the printer's 
trade and located in Cape May, where he carried on a successful business 
for some time. During the civil war he joined the First New Jersey Cav- 
alry and was in the service for four and a half years, a most loyal defender 
of his adopted country. Captured by the enemy he was incarcerated in 
Libby prison for three months, after which he was exchanged and served 
in the hospital as steward; subsequently he received a commission in the 
medical corps and held the rank of Major at the time of the surrender of the 
Confederate army. Returning to the north, he became a student in the 
Philadelphia Dental College, where he was graduated with the class of 
1867. He then opened an office in Philadelphia, and also one in Cape May, 
and has since been successfully engaged in practice. He is especially in- 
terested in musical services in camp-meetings and has been a composer of 
much sacred music. He holds membership in the Methodist Episcopal 
church and takes an active part in its work and has been a trustee and 
steward in the congregation in which his membership is placed. He has 
also served as a class-leader and superintendent of the Sunday-school. He 
belongs to the Masonic fraternity and is an exemplary representative of 
that benevolent order. 

Dr. Gilmour, Sr., was united in marriage to ]\Iiss Letitia Howard, and 
their union has been blest with three children: L. H., the subject of this 
review; L. D. H., a resident of Newark, New Jersey, and Mary P, 

H. L. Gilmour, Jr,, was reared under the paternal roof and supple- 
mented his preliminary education by a course in the South Jersey Institute, 
where he was graduated in 1884. Determined to devote his life to the 
practice of dental surgery, he matriculated in the Philadelphia Dental Col- 
lege, and after completing a thorough course he was g-raduated, in 1889. 



CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. 593 

He then joined his father in practice, and they have a most pleasant suite 
of rooms at No. 1520 Chestnut street. Philadelphia. Their office is most 
thoroughly equipped with all modern appliances, and the efficiency of and 
skill of both the senior and junior dentist has secured to them a very liberal 
patronage. 

On the 4th of June. 1890. Dr. H. L. Gilmour. Jr., was married to Miss 
Lena M. Cunningham, a daughter of Thomas Cunningham, who was a very 
prominent citizen of Delaware and sen-ed as a member of the state legisla- 
ture. They had two children, but both are now deceased. The Doctor 
and his wife share the hospitality of the best homes of Wenonah and their 
circle of friends and acquaintances is very extensive. In his professional 
life he has already gained enviable distinction, and the future undoubtedly 
holds in store for him a successful career. 



THE EVENING NEWS. BRIDGETON, NEW JERSEY. 

The Bridgeton Evening News, one of the most pronounced journalistic 
successes of the state, with the "largest circulation of any <laily or weekly 
paper in New Jersey south of Camden." has an interesting history. Its 
first number was February i. 1879. with ominous shakings of heads and 
discouraging words showered upon its venturesome proprietors, J. Ward 
Richardson,' J. H. C. Applegate and Paul J. Davis: but determination, a 
clear comprehension of the rapid progress in store for Bridgeton, the pa- 
tience and knowledge requisite to educate the popular mind to an apprecia- 
tion of a live local daily paper, and fifty-one dollars in cash constituted the 
capital. The original financing of the enterprise is thus amusingly told in 
the recent souvenir edition of the paper : 

"When the appointed time came for each member of the new firm to 
hand out twenty dollars, as previously agreed upon, one of the trio (courtesy 
compels that no names be mentioned here), was in dire straits. Despite his 
most vigorous searching among his old clothes in odd corners, he was 
forced to declare his inability to raise more than seventeen dollars. This 
brought a change of base. The remaining two each hastily grabbed three 
dollars from the stupendous pile in front of them and the three hopefuls 
contributed just seventeen dollars each as their magnificent capital for 
launching the sheet upon a heartless and unfeeling world 1" 

The initial numbers consisted of a five column folio, eighteen and one- 
half by twenty-four inches, remotely prophetic of its subsequent expan- 
sion; and vet', nine-tenths of its advertising space for the year ha<l been

sold, a Iwo-column advertisement had declined to put room for reading 
space, one advertiser had been requested to reduce his card, and the venture 
had five hundred pay subscribers. 

At the outset John Walker, a negro, was the "steam power"; a suc- 
cessful manufacturer now on North Laurel street was the ofifice man; Rich- 
ardson managed the business end: Applegate hustled for the news; and 
Davis looked after the type-setting and printing. The first location was on 
East Commerce street, where the law office of A. R. Fithian is now lo- 
cated. A change was subsequently made to the corner of Commerce and 
Cohansey streets, and later the plant was removed to No. 3 Laurel street, 
where the firm, now beginning to prosper, bought the property. Here the 
Evening News with its companion paper the Dollar Weekly grew and pros- 
pered and played no unimportant part in making the history of Bridgeton. 

On Alarch 24, 1886, adjoining properties, Nos. 70, 72 and 74 East Com- 
merce street, were purchased, and soon afterward the business office was 
removed to yz Commerce street. A few months later, the firm needing 
room, a brief addition was erected in the rear of 74 Commerce street and 
the plant removed, occupying the entire property. The second floor of No. 
72 has recently been added and is used as a job-printing department, and a 
doorway cut through connecting with the main offices, making it one of 
the most complete and best equipped printing offices in the state. 

Among the first advertisers of the paper were S. E. McGear & Brothers. 
P. H. Goldsmith, Reeves & Fithian, W. Robbins, John McPherson, George 
H. Whipple. W. G. Fisher (Philadelphia), Mrs. H. A. Mead, N. Elmer & 
Brother, A. H. Gregon,-, and W. H. \\'oodrufif, many of whom are still in 
business in Bridgeton. 

Mr. Davis having early sold out his interest to the remaining partners, 
Messrs. Applegate & Richardson continued the proprietors until January 
I, 1889, when David C. Applegate succeeded his father as a member of the 
firm. Two years later, he having withdrawn, J. W. Richardson has since 
then been the sole proprietor. The plant and paper are owned by Mr. Rich- 
ardson, — the most valuable newspaper property in southern New Jersey and 
its location one of the most valuable in the city. 

The Evening News, with its companion publication the Dollar Weekly, 
though started practically without capital, paid expenses from the start. The 
leading features have been a circulation based upon live local city and county 
news gleaned from every possible quarter, and printed even to the exclusion 
of advertising matter; its strict attention being to the small details of home 
life. This latter feature gave rise to the "Personal Department," at first se- 
verely criticised, but now universally followed by all leading metropolitan

journals. The Evening News is carefully edited, is a clean sheet with Bill- 
ingsgate journalism unknown to its columns, which, stanchly Republican, 
it is so fair to all parties that Democrats. Prohibitionists and Populists are 
its regular readers. With a circulation ranging from 3,600 to 4,800 at high 
water mark the News is known from one end of the state to the other and is 
accorded by the "American Newspaper Directory" the largest circulation 
in Cumberland county. 



JOSEPH R. BECKETT. 

One of the leading farmers of Eogan township. Gloucester county, is 
Joseph Richards Beckett, who owns and cultivates about eighty acres of land, 
which has been in his possession since 1883. He has one of the well culti- 
^-ated farms of the locality, on which are found all the improvements and 
accessories seen on the property of the most advanced agriculturists of the 
period. His fields are well tilled and in the autumn golden harvests reward his 
labors. The buildings are commodious and substantial and everything about 
the place indicates the thrift and enterprise of the owner. 

Mr. Beckett is a native of Bridgeport, New Jersey, his birth having oc- 
curred on the 1 2th of March, 1850. His grandfather, William Beckett, mar- 
ried a Miss Iszard. and his maternal grandfather was Joseph Richards, whose 
wife was Miss Pederick in her maidenhood. Both families were of English 
lineage. Josiah B.' Beckett, the father of our subject, was bom near Barns- 
boro. New Jersey, and after arriving at the years of maturity married Miss 
Mary Richards, a native of Bridgeport, and they had five children, namely : 
William Henry, who died at the age of forty-seven years; Sarah Ann, who 
died at the age of fourteen years; Mary Elizabeth, deceased wife of William 
J. Peterson, of Penn Grove; Joseph R.; and Frank, who died at the age of 
four years. After the death of his first wife, the father of these children 
married Sybilla Daniels Horner, by whom he had eight children, namely: 
Samuel, who died at the age of two years; one who died in infancy; George, 
who has been an employe in the United States pension bureau for twelve 
years; Sarah, who is married and resides upon a farm near Woodbury, New- 
Jersey; Isabella, who died at the age of ten years; Annie L., a resident of 
Woodbury; Josiah B.; and Charles, who died at the age of two years. 

Mr. Beckett, whose name introduces this sketch, was educated in the 
public schools of Logan township, Bridgeport, and Swedesboro, and in a pri- 
vate school conducted by Professor Russell, of Penn Grove. He further pre- 
pared for the practical duties of life by a commercial course in Eastman's 
Business College, in which he was graduated in the class of 1873. He then

engaged in farming, which has since engaged his attention, together with 
marketing and a commission business. His father was the owner of one 
hundred and sixty-five acres of land, eighty-two acres of which was pur- 
chased by WilHam Henry Beckett, some time before the father's death, and 
the remainder of the property was purchased by Joseph R. Beckett, in 1883. 
a year after his father's death. Since that time he has carried on agricultural 
pursuits with a marked degree of success. 

In 1885 occurred the marriage of Mr. Beckett and Miss Susannah Just- 
ice, a daughter of William P. Justice, of Bridgeport, and four children ha\e 
been born to them, — William Justice, Mary Richards, Altha Elizabeth and 
Emma Justice. 

Mr. Beckett votes with the Democratic party and is deeply interested in 
everything tending to secure its success. He was for three years a member 
of the township committee and is now a member of the school board of 
Logan township, in which capacity he has served for several vears. Sociallv 
he is connected with Swedesboro Grange, the American Order of United 
Workmen, of Bridgeport, and is a past grand of Bridgeport Lodge, L O. O. 
F. He and his family hold membership in the Center Square Methodist 
Episcopal church, and among its members have many friends. Their well 
spent lives indicate their belief and they are regarded as representative citi- 
zens of the community.
