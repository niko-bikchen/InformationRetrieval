Yes, I am a data scientist and yes, you did read the title correctly, but someone had to say it. We read so many stories about data science being the sexiest job of the 21st century and the attractive sums of money that you can make as a data scientist that it can seem like the absolute dream job. Factor in that the field contains an abundance of highly skilled people geeking out to solve complex problems (yes it’s a positive thing to “geek out”), there is everything to love about the job.
But the truth is that data scientists typically “spend 1–2 hours a week looking for a new job” as stated in this article by the Financial Times. Furthermore, the article also states that “Machine learning specialists topped its list of developers who said they were looking for a new job, at 14.3 per cent. Data scientists were a close second, at 13.2 per cent.” These data were collected by Stack Overflow in their survey based on 64,000 developers.
I too have been in that position and have recently switched data science jobs myself.
So why are so many data scientists looking for new jobs?
Before I answer that question I should clarify that I am still a data scientist. On the whole, I love the job and I don’t want to discourage others from aspiring to be data scientists because it can be fun, stimulating and rewarding. The aim of this article is to play devil’s advocate and expose some of the negative aspects of the job.
