 remember thinking myself, “I got this!”. I knew regression modeling; both linear and logistic regression. My boss was right. In my tenure, I exclusively built regression-based statistical models. I wasn’t alone. In fact, at that time, regression modeling was the undisputed queen of predictive analytics. Fast forward fifteen years, the era of regression modeling is over. The old queen has passed. Long live the new queen with a funky name; XGBoost or Extreme Gradient Boosting!
